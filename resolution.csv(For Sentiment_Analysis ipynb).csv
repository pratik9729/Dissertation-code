Customer Data
 Back in 2017 I reported an overflow pipe as leaking and requested it be looked at as did a surveyor who visited the property.. this work was never complete and has now resulted in damage/flood 
 This highlighted the importance of good communication and ownership and we are working with the customer to ensure that all other repairs raised are completed. Legacy IT systems do not help these processes develop.
" would like to launch a formal complaint about an electrician who was sent to my property for the repair of my living room storage heater on 09/10/2018.I answered the door to the electrician and he was leaning over the balcony with earphones in listening to music. I opened my door to him, he came in without introducing himself or explaining that he had come about the heater, he just walked in. He didn't take out his earphone, and proceeded to the living room where I told him that the bedroom storage heater had previously and the action taken was a new heater was fitted. He then said ""Well I'll just put down to order a new one then"". He was extremely rude and extremely unprofessional. I felt uncomfortable in my own home and feel strongly enough about this to make a formal complaint. He never gave me his name, but I do not want the same electrician to come to my property again"
 Specific jobs highlighted on visit to be booked and resolved by propertycare. Dates and issues included in response letter.
"	• Scheduling were waiting on an update from the Supervisors however once the email was sent this was not chased and it took 6 weeks to get a response with 2 chasers. I understand that the process has now changed and we are better staffed now but we still need to ensure that any queries are emailed and then followed up with calls or in person when in the office. Natalie - I believe a process is now in place for this but we need to ensure that we are actively following up with supervisors to ensure that we get responses to the emails we send.
	• If a job needs to be rebooked due to sickness - it is not fair to make the tenant wait another 3-4 weeks. We need to be making sure that these are prioritised. In this case, the job was rearranged 3 times and each time they had to wait so long which is not fair - Natalie, Ashley - Can this process please be reviewed as we should be prioritising rearrange apps. This tenant was pushed back 4 weeks 4 times in a row which is not acceptable.
We need better comms with contractors - Gary had the scaffolding up for 4 days and we had no idea until the tenant told us as she was cross the works hadn't been done. Natalie - can we please ensure that are following up with contractors and tracking when scaffolding has been put up."
"	• Scott advised tenant we would get an emergency appointment booked in and all we said was 'are you in today, I will get someone round as quickly as I can'. No notes were left but the appointment was not until the following day. Whilst this was within 24 hours, we should have set the expectations better with the tenant. No notes were left to confirm Scott had spoken with the tenant.
Scott sent an email to Supervisors on the 12th of May asking for advice following a report to say that the tenant had concerns with his health. We did not follow this up until 3 days later when the tenant called up to chase and report further concerns. The Sups didn't reply for 7 days so we wouldn't have chased until then which would have led to a longer delay had the tenant not called in."
"	• We need to ensure that complaints are picked up straight away. This was an unfortunate circumstance but we still need to prioritise that first contact once the complaint comes in. 
	• There was a delay getting the PO sent over so we need to make sure that these are sent over as soon as they are raised to avoid delays.
I will provide feedback to our Scheduling Team to ensure that the engineers who attended are fully aware of the job they are attending and that they remain professional whilst at the property. "
"
We are employing a 3rd contractor, just to do your doors, so that you do not have to wait further whilst other jobs are done.

That said, we have now been able to arrange delivery of some special door/window sets and will be able to install them on Wednesday 29th June. 

We may even be able to do it sooner, but this is a guaranteed date from the contractor. 

I know also that you and your neighbours at 19 and 20 Dickens Close are experiencing some health problems and that we will need to make special arrangements for you all, while the works are being carried out, to reduce the noise and stress for you.

I have been in touch with the independent living team, which has specialist officers, and one of them, Elaine Booth, will be your direct liaison with the property team and contractors. She will keep you regularly updated on all things and will make the arrangements for you for the day of the installation.

You can contact her directly on 01452 834188. If you are unable to contact her at any time, do please contact me on 01452 833151.

I am authorised to offer you £50 compensation, as a gesture of goodwill, and we will make arrangements to pay you as soon as we receive the enclosed form, completed with your preference for payment.

"(28/7 - notice given on 1, 3 Hathaway Close).  Water ingress was a new issue and not what was highlighted on previous complaint. A Management move was facilitated on the basis it was rising damp but this was not the issue. Tenant was moved quickly and there was no evidence to show that he was not kept in contact with at any point. No evidence found at the property of infestation as claimed by the customer."
"“From the 9/7/18 until the present day, GCH have intentionally endangered the health and safety of others or by their conduct was reckless, whether such health or personal safety was endangered by not completing repairs, leaving residents without hot water on numerous occasions including my 3 month old child and as a result, my place still looks like a building site. When I came in to speak with someone about the asbestos, a lady called Shelly/Shirley told me and my girlfriend that it is okay as asbestosis wouldn’t affect us until later life which I found very unprofessional.” Mr S Davies has called in regarding multiple repairs that needed completing. Mr S Davies is Miss Barry's partner and we do have permission to speak with him on a one time basis until they fill in our 'consent to share' forms I have sent out in the post. Lee Dorrington attended and informed the tenant it would be sorted. This was first reported on 10/7/18 where we attended the same day and clarified parts would be needed as the boiler was quite old. Miss Barry's property is now down for a heating upgrade as a result of this. Mr S Davies and Miss Barry haven't received a call in regards to paint vouchers as well as the installation of the new boiler. Mr Davies is concerned as winter is approaching and the property is in poor state."
£100 goodwill gesture and boiler has bene repaired. 
"£20.00 to cover the cost of the temporary heater you purchased privately.
£15.00 for the clothing you had to throw away following your fall.
£32.00 to cover the charges for the temporary heaters (2 heaters, £4 a day for 4 days).
£30 to cover the taxi charges taking you to and from the hospital following your falls. "
£30 for poor service from out of hours.
£30 goodwill gesture and the door has been repaired.
£50 goodwill and the fence has now been repaired. 
£84 for unpaid leave partner had to take and £28 for temp heater. Boiler has been repaired now and all within timeframes. Apologised for the poor comms she has experienced especially relating to her complaint.

"•	On several occasions internal departments at GCH did not communicate to agree a way forward or emails were not responded to and actioned upon. We are now making sure that we have regular meetings with other departments to be able to raise specific issues and cases to ensure there is never a gap in communication. 

•	We need to complete a review of our follow-on process as several actions did not happen following inspections or surveys. The process needs to ensure that once an inspection is completed, the notes and actions required need to be processed straight away and clearly noted on the system to ensure that the works are arranged as soon as possible. 

•	I am going to ensure that any emails sent internally are not sent to individual staff members. We will need to make sure these are sent a communal inbox to limit the risk of emails being missed due to staff sickness and annual leave. "
"•	One of the Neighbourhood Managers emailed you directly on the 14/11/22 with two additional documents to help explain the fence boundary lines and stated that they would look into the “visits to the property by appointment only” and that he would get back to you on this 
•	Following the above email, the Neighbourhood Manager has also been in touch to explain the contract and is sending another copy to the property
•	A member of the PropertyCare team has been liaising with you and agreed the following works to-date:
o	Repairs leaks to the garage - Appointment booked for 5th Dec
o	Renew 2x gulley grates
o	Supply a small bottle of mould wash
o	A new time clock for control of the hot water has been ordered and will be fitted once in stock by GCH electrical contractor
o	The damaged driveway has been measured and the details of this will be sent over to the GCH Asset team for approval before any works commences
o	It has also been confirmed that GCH do not own the long boundary fence in question"
"•	Renew dividing fence between the blocks of flats i.e., Block 6-8 & Block 10-11: Approx 17m of 900mm chain-link fence with three straining lines. (Note - that it is important that the contractor ensures the straining lines are tensioned correctly on installation.) "
"•	The front facia, underfelt to roof (in area of concern) and gutter will need to be renewed to resolve the issue
•	However, the gutter is connected to you neighbour’s property and both properties will need to have the new gutter installed in order to alleviate the problem you have been experiencing. As your neighbour’s home is privately owned GCH will be contacting them seeking permission to do this work."
"•	We need to be clear on responsibilities when it comes to Gas services. This will involve training our staff to ensure we are clear on tenant and GCH responsibilities. 
•	We need to be proactive when we are waiting for a part. If we know the part could take a few weeks, we need to be making sure we have checked other suppliers and be actively chasing this to ensure a speed process for the tenant. "
"•	We need to make sure that we review the current process that is in place for the tracking of follow-on works. We need to ensure that we are able to send weekly chasers to engineers following a job to make sure that repairs are not missed and are booked within the appropriate timescales. 
•	We need to make sure that engineers are taking the right action following a repair visit to ensure that mistakes are not made following work at a property. This could be a meeting with all of the engineers to ensure they know the correct processes and just to provide feedback about be vigilant when completing work or creating follow on work. 
•	The communication between GCH staff and the engineers has been poor for this tenant so feedback could be given about this tenant’s situation to ensure that we can improve the communication with engineers. We need to be emailing an engineer for an update and if no response we need to be texting or calling for updates. "
"•	We never received a report from Will B following his inspection. We need to make sure the reports are being sent over straight away. I believe this process is already being implemented but we need to make sure that this is happening as we are still getting issues.
•	Tenant and CX had to chase Scheduling several times over 7 months without any action being taken. Scheduling needs to ensure that we are responding and actioning all emails that are coming in. Natalie K - can you please raise this with your team and ensure that they are aware of this issue?
•	All schedulers not to email engineers for missing info etc but to call them and the to raise with sups the fact that an engineer failed to follow process with sending the full details in - Natalie K- I believe this has already been implemented but just to make sure it continues to happen.•	The tenant called in several times and spoke to the CX team. Each advisor sent an email to Scheduling for an update but there was never any follow up from CX or Scheduling and no action was taken following each call. We need to make sure that we raise this further if we notice the tenant keeps calling with no actions being taken."
"•	When an inspection is carried out, I will ensure that a formal report must be sent completed and uploaded as soon as possible so the agreed works can be arranged.
•	Every call conversation relating to a particular job will be documented. I identified you’re your call on the 27th of January was not documented and therefore we were unaware you had raised this issue on this date.
•	Feedback will be given to our contractors to explain all appointments must be attended to on the day or confirmation sent to you if this needed to be arranged. 
•	Feedback will be provided to all teams involved as it is clear that when the request for an inspection was passed to our Asset team, the communication was very poor which led to a delay in any action being taken at the property. "
"02/07/2020 - MD spoke to customer.  Site visit required to see externals.  MD & DL (Development) to attend 08/07/2020 so extension agreed. 17/07/2020 - Spoke to customer to clarify the promises made about the fencing, she advised she has a letter clarifying it and it had aready been measured up.  She is also claiming the plans confimed lights would be low level so is directly against what had been agreed.  Agreed further extension.  24/07/2020 left voicemail for customer to discuss outcome.  Response states that lighting was as per plans, but angle will be moved by 10 degrees to shine more into new development.  Fencing was delayed due to covid and manufacturers on furlough."

Complaint extended. 17/07/2020 - Confirmed with customer that roofer has located the issue and we are confident this is the root cause but can't guarantee it.  Most works have already been completed, but some materials are on order which should be done by the end of next week.  We will need to assess after poor weaterh to confirm if the fix has worked and if so, we will complete the internal.  If not, we will start proceedings for a management move."

"1. Scheduling team to put a system in place whereby  all follow up works from contractors are reviewed daily and intern passed to the relevant managers / supervisors and that recorded that they have been passed to the relevant people so it can be tracked.  2. Scheduling team / CX team and out of hours call centre need to react in a more efficient manor when situations like this arise, when a resident or a neighbour of one of our properties calls in to state they have water coming through the floor of their property and they know the root cause, we should react to this quicker and if that means getting the PC supervisor or manager to attend asap then so be it, this whole situation could have been mitigated if the communication and ownership of when this call come in to the business was managed correctly."

1.Email was sent by NM 30/6/22 stating thst the lady would complete the clearance required within the week. this email was sent to a repairs operative who had done the origional inspection. and really should have been sent to scheduling and repairs so they could book the work. The operative should have also picked up this email and sent to repairs/Scheduling. None of these actions happened so the repair was left until the tenant rang back in chasing minths later.  2. The attending operative did not speak or ring anyone at GCH when he couldnt find the panel that needed repairing. I he had have done this he would of been told where the panel was and this part of the complaint would have never happened.
"10/07/2020 - Spoke to customer for a 2nd time after visiting with a surveyor.  We have addressed most issues but we agreed not to close down until we are comfortable its in a lettable standard.  Agreed weekly updates would take place on a Friday. 17/07/2020, no answer & no voicemail. 24/07/2020 - visited property with the customer, we agreed we were nearly there and she was impressed by the change.  We are expecting a close in 2 weeks. 06/08/2020 - confirmed to customer that we are in a position for her to move in. There are a couple of minor works to be completed which she was happy with. As a good will gesture, we are arranging for Advance Removals to assist with the actual move"

"12/12/2022 - called tenant who confirmed job was complete this morning. Awarded £30 as good will due to us not attending an emergency appointment within our agreed 4 hours slot. Their concerns regarding the hygeine of manually filling the cistern was invalid - as its a clean water supply.

"16/03 email sent, no response. Followed up 21/03 - Complaint withdrwan as tenant wants to follow disrepair process"
"17/07/2020 - Customer has advised her daughters Amazon Fire tablet screen was smashed after Greenflame had piled things on top of the bed.  She also had issues with holes drilled through walls and mess left.  Hewers have already visisted to do a post inspection.  Awaiting outcome of this inspection.  23/07/2020 - Greenflame were due to arrange for collection of the tablet on Monday but did not turn up.

Apologised to the customer, advising it is being managed internally by the contractors. Customer was happy with the response."
18/03- I have not been able to get hold of the tenant - he promised photos would be sent by email but none received. Letter of apology sent. Novus have undertaken all works and customer has confirmed satisfaction to them. Novus will not pay any compensation for this complaint as they do not feel their operative was rude and resident let them in the following day with no issues. 
2 leaks from flat above in 2 years and neither time was the property dried out properly. De-humidifiers needs to be left for at least 5 days with them running for at least 8 hours a day.  Mould wash was carried out to hall and bathroom but because walls were not dried out properly the damp has come back through. Also blown plaster behind the tiles in the shower area was not rectified after leak.
"2. Scheduling team / CX team and out of hours call centre need to react in a more efficient manor when situations like this arise, when a resident or a neighbour of one of our properties calls in to state they have water coming through the floor of their property and they know the root cause, we should react to this quicker and if that means getting the PC supervisor or manager to attend asap then so be it, this whole situation could have been mitigated if the communication and ownership of when this call come in to the business was managed correctly."
28/07/2020 - Site visit made to the customer to assess the damage to the property.  We agreed it will take a while to process and gather more feedback.  Surveyor has advised it requires further review. Have commited we will stay in contact throughout but agreed that this did not occur previously and apologised for the inconvenience.
"30/6/2022 - I have phoned Miss Aziz today and discussed her complaint - she wants solutions and the works to be done and nothing more, which is great for us if we can get this done ASAP for her. - I have gained more detail and spoken to Steve W in order to assess what can be done on the repairs front - I have advised I will be investigating and i will phone her next week with a solution and then put it in writing for her - she was happy with this response at this time.  I have been able to work with P C team and have responded with a set of actions and dates for appoitnmetns and resolutions in place - customer has been kept informed throughout and has been happy with the results so far and the levels of communications - description of planned appointments have been added to the response letter and hopefully the complaint can be closed with a positive resolution "
"30/7/2020 Visited with a surveyor midweek.  Customer advised she needs to send in some pictures for full visibilty. Works are due to commence 10/08/2020 - customer has requested complaint is extended until completion.  04/09/2020 - works have commenced but still not completed.  02/10/2020 - Works have been completed fully, customer is happy and property is now tenanted again. Have offered apologies as the Surveyor advised we didn't act quickly enough on it.  Agreed a compensation package by way of a an apology which the customer accepted."
"31 May 2022 spoke at length with Mr Powell at RWH with Karen.  Some confusion from him around which lock change, however he was adamant that we had given keys to a neighbour and subsequently items from his property had gone missing.   He wanted food and a phone.  Hard to ascertain if he had gone to the police as he kept saying that they were corrupt.  Following the meeting phoned the 2 trades colleagues who had carried out lock changes.  The one confirmed that following the police attending, he changed the locks and gave the keys to the neighbour.  Therefore complaint upheld as we should not have done this.  Compensation offered only on the basis of this and the inconvenience that it has caused him.  Compensation amount £250.00 to reflect fully upheld complaint and moving towards moderate impact.  Letter and compensation form sent to Matt Dunne to ask him to print out and post and also he has a copy if Mr Powell comes back in to the office.  I will try and email them as well but he did not have access to emails when I spoke to him yesterday, despite GCH loaning him a tablet.  I've also referred him to tenancy sustainment team again as he has regularly come in asking for food vouchers.  1/6/22 emailed Tenancy Sustainment & NM"
5/8/20: Initial call to tenant to understand issues. Enquiries within GCH being made. Initial response to complainant 7/8/20 by emailed letter: Garage inspection to be 10/8 and surveyor visit re. heating/tap/wc to be 20/8. Joint inspection by LP and GL 20/8. Heating installation to be added to EmDee schedule as a priority. New wash hand basin and hot tap to be installed as part of heating installation. Garage to be re-pointed - referred to JP. (Toilet flush re-fill is OK - no action required.)
"6/5/20 - MD spoke to tenant. Raft of issues to investigate. 
22/5/20 - MD spoke to tenant. 
29/5/20 - MD spoke to tenant earlier this week. There are differing views across GCH and work continues to find a solution. Tenant is aware that work is ongoing and that he will be contacted again during the next few weeks. 
19/06/2020 - Tenant provided a 36 page document for further review.  He is aware this will take addtional time and we may require legal advice.
10/07/2020 - MD spoke to tenant re. potential consultation with other tenants but this was not well received. MD reconsidering options.  
31/7/2020 - Spoke to customer, outcome agreed in principal but finer details still needs to be added.  Outcome - Apologised for lack of responses.  Development officer to scope out the works with a small consulation in his block on the proviso that if any other blocks challenge, we may need to get legal advice.
"
"6no voicemails left, 2 emails, 1 letter- no replies. Email sent asking to contact. No contact from customer, letter sent closing complaint"
8 March - customer rescinded complaint - if agreed works are carried out on the 19/03/2021 they will be more than happy. Tree is to be reduced to 6ft and checked to make sure the tenant at 10 Darwin then keeps them in order as per their tenancy agreement.
A case should have been raised to Assets and we should have replaced the door within 28 days which did not happen. Will refer to Ant in Assets to run a training session. 
"A complex and unique case where multiple agencies were involved. Support and advice provided through-out this difficult time. I concluded that we had enough information on the system to have proceeded to a w\off and I authorised this as part of the resolution. I admitted the error that happened was the recent contact made re fta for mothers account. Write off form raised by team to be processed. email sent with response letter today, await any response to see if resolution been accepted. "
A conversation has been had with MBM being careful with properties. 
A greater sense of ownership was required in terms of the communication with the customer. With the matter having been referred to Estate Services there was no follow up contact regarding the delivery and reasons for the delay. 
A larger percentage of contractor work should be audited to ensure that no works are overlooked.
A new job should have been raised for when the intercom was reported for a second time.
A number of lessons learnt including a change to our complaints procedure to ensure customers are contacted if we are dealing with their complaint informally or as a service request.
A refresher may be needed in terms of how complaints are dealt with within the organisation. This can be undertaken as part of the new team development following the Housing Services restructure.
A review will need to be undertaken of the automatic data transfer process to assess if there is any way of excluding vulnerable from the survey processes. Performance issues with staff member at Voluntas are being addressed to ensure learning .
"A thorough investigation was carried out including a detailed conversation with the tenant, 3 incident reports gathered form GCH staff present and a subsequent meeting to discuss fully. There was no evidence to enable the complaint to be upheld."
"A visit took place with the customer. He was seeking assurance that there would be no futher leaks. We advised that everything that was reasonably possible had been completed to ensure this did not reoccur. The customer raised some other repair issues during the visit, arrangements have been made to complete these."
"A visit was raised for the corrct skilled operative to attend, who fixed the issue."
"A reminder by email has been sent to the Tenancy Services, ASB and Community Investment Teams confirming the different ways which we can received a complaint request from a customer. I highlighted that this should be in accordance with the customers preferences an in line with GCH's Complaints Policy"
"Access issues with heating should be managed by Housing for either injunctions or confirmation letters, closing down the job formally and enforcing the tenants liabilty if the property falls into disrepair."
Access plans were already in place with contractors.  From a GCH perspective we would have been unable to improve upon this as it was down to human error with contractors which has been addressed through the contract manager.   
access points have been filled with  cememt rather then foam which will stop any vermin if the problem should ever return in the future.  Access point around the whole building have also been filled to stop any access from outside. Loft area has been baited to kill of any  current habitants and will be monitored (Any dead vermin will be removed). An offer has been made to sort out the flooring by the front door and kitchen when the customer is happy that the vermin problem has been resolved. will check in with Mr Daniels weekly for the next 3 months to get updates (reminders set up in my calendar) and have also asked the pest control contractor to keep me updated on progress. Have agreed to meet pest contractors on there next scheduled vist 9/5/22 to ensure they are clesr on what has been agreed.
"Action on urgent repair requests needs to be more timely and people need to take ownership of jobs. A few surveyors visited this property and nothing had been done, possibly because people had different ideas as to the cause (now pinned down to lack of insulation in the roof space). Surveys to be centralised through a single surveyor - requests go onto CRM for the Asset Team and allocated via a gatekeeper - alongside Stock Condition (M Harris)"
"Action plan should always be completed with customer during ASB report to make sure that any actions are agreed - need to make sure that temporary staff from agencies are aware of procedures and follow them.  Also need to avoid making personal comments, no matter how well intentioned. 
ASB policy and procedure are currently being reviewed and emphasis will be placed on action plan and agreeing with complainant of ASB how they wish it to be dealt with."
Action taken againt MessageLink employee but this was a one off occurrence.
Actions already in progress. No new learnings.
Addressed directly with the contractor. Property Care Supervisors will post inspect a larger proportion of contractor jobs.
Addressed issues with contracting partner.  SIte visit completed by void manager who agreed a new schedule of works and apologised to the customer.  Goodwill gesture given towards the repair cost of the tenants pool.
Addressed issues with contracting partner.  Their assessment was a mis-placed attempt at banter.  We have advised we will not accept this moving forwards.  Apologies offered to customer.
Addtional training provided to temp workers.
Adjusted the properties MVHR system to be running at maximum capacity. Agreed to install small hinges and latches to the existing windows. This will make them slightly openable. Resident is happy with this outcome. Property was extremely hot. 
"Advice given on evidential threshold for noise nuisance and signposted to City Council. I am satisfied that there have been a number of actions taken by the ASB team in an attempt to resolve the case but there is little or no evidence to support a legal escalation. The conversation between the tenants husband and Paul Reilly cannot be evidenced. However, tenant agreed that a resolution would be for her case to be allocated to a new officer, which has been agreed but I have not upheld the complaint as I believe there has been an ongoing/ sufficient response by the ASB team."
Advice given regarding Housing Options. 
"Advised on longer than hoped for times on OT referrals and was within target of 12-16 weeks. Apologised for delay, custoemr's sone is hoping to pursuade parents to look at alternative accomodation. Customer happy works are on site this week."
Advised that balcony works due to be completed by end of August 2022 and confirmed that arrangements will be in place for future notifying complainants that their complaint is being closed to ensure they are satisfied with outcome. 
"After a discussion with the managers involved, we have identified learning outcomes from the complaint which will really help us to improve going forwards. I have established that only 1 manager call back was attempted with a voicemail left when we should have tried at least twice. If we had managed to speak to th customer then the additional information to deem this an emergency could have been picked up. Another learning outcome we have established is that we believed that they had a walk-in bathroom as this was still recorded on the account, however after further investigation we have found a bath was re-installed before they had moved in. This would have impacted the decision to deny an emergency appointment. I have offered a payment of £50.00 that has been accepted for the cost of the repair done privately as a goodwill gesture (no receipts to prove this repair) and offered our apologies for the incident and any upset caused."
"After a joint visit with senior surveyor (IL) we have explained to the customer why their neighbour had a heating and window upgrade before them, this was becuase 16 Hill hay was surveyed by Ridge (National Surveying Consultants) in 2015, element renewal dates were set then. 
14 Hill Hay surveyed by Martin in 2019 & element renewal dates set. Windows and a heating due for upgrade in financial year 22-23 (April onwards) Iona has asked for this property to be a priority but cannot at this stage give a date. A new front door has also been ordered (nothing wrong with old one but is due an upgrade). The heating upgrasde is reliant on wales and west completing the gas connection and then the customer arranging for a utility company to fit the meter, This was explained to the customer and they were advised that we could offer support in finding a supplier through our enhanced support coaches. We have also enquired to see if we can provide some heating vouchers as they are struggling with paying to heat the house.
"
"After investigation it is clear that a mistake had been made by Amica 24 - they had used the wrong customer information and help did not arrive for the customer. The lack of communication was also down to Amica as the letter of apology never arrived (this has been re-sent). I believed the refund was already being dealt with but did not check payment had been made. A refund of £102.05 has now been offered (charges from February 2021 until the error was rectified), an apology given and a bunch of flowers was delivered personally on 16/07/2021. Costs are to be recovered from Amica."
"After listening to the call recordings, the information provided by the customer during our conversation was contrasting. Shereen had not refused to assist and made several ateempts to clarify an action plan with the tenant. She acknowledged his concerns and offered reassurance. The conversation was made more difficult as the customers' friend / support could be heard in the background shouting and prompting the customer on what to say. (I experienced the same when I contacted the customer to discuss the complaint. I advised the customer that I was finding it difficult with the background noise and would speak to him first and then to his friend.) "
"After making contact with Ms Hodges, it was clear that the information had not been correctly relayed to her. Once informed complaint did not stand. We did discuss some addtional information like clearing the notice board which was completed 18th Novemeber 2022"
"After my investigation, GCH were never informed of the damp and mould issues at the property until the complaint was raised. As soon as the issue was brought to our attention we acted straight away to resolve. No learning outcomes identified. "
"After several attempts to contact complainant, spoke to Miss Starowicki and agreed a visit to home to discuss rehousing/HomeSeeker Plus application. The 12 March visit - to suit Miss Starowicki - established there are no outstanding repair/maintenance issues at the property.
Further visit made 12 March (JH/KS) re. the customers main issue of concern which is with the City Council in terms of her Homeseeker application for which she has not as yet received an acknowledgement or response to her initial email. As such she confirmed that she wished to withdraw the complaint with GCH and we’ve agreed that we will support her with a representation to the City Council and by forwarding a Provider Report.

"
After speaking to customer (23/7/21) it was explained that we had sprayed the first dose of Glyphosate on the 15/7/21 and the results were already showing. It was agreed we would return and apply a second dose on the 28/7/21 and knock on her door so customer was aware we had visited. It was also agreed that I would raise the poor communication between departments as tenant was frustrated at getting different messages. 
After speaking to the customers' son it was established that his Mother had not been transferred to the new provider for Lifelink alarms. This has left her feeling unsafe even though the error has been rectified. Agreed that customer had not received a service during a period of time and confirmed charges for this period would be refunded. We also arranged for the Customers alarm to be tested again to build up their confidence for when and if they use it in the future.
After speaking to the gas engineer who attended an OOH breakdown he has assured me that the faulty on/off valve was not evident when he topped up the pressure on the boiler. The engineer also confirmed the heating was working when he left so had no reason to suspect there was another issue. 
After speaking with Mrs Goodwin I explained that although unfortunate as the leak was not our fault she would need to claim for her carpets etc through her contents insurance (which she does not have). I have put her in touch with Mandi Holt who is looking at funding options to help her. We will also use our community volunteering days to help with the redecoration which will be done in the new year. Fire alarm to be reattached 10/11/22
"After undertaking a second inspection of the garden (with no asbestos found) I have agreed to do a one off garden cut as a goodwill gesture, and so we can give 100% reassurance that no asbestos is left in the garden. "
"After visiting property 14/1/22 I agree with the engineer recommendations on the repairs. Although this is not what the customer wanted, he has allowed the works to go ahead 26/1/22. Several attempts were made to carry out this work within 20 working days but we had no access twice then the customer would not let the work on the kitchen units start until he had spoken to a supervisor - this request was further delayed by the supervisor having Covid before Christmas and the customers son having Covid after Christmas."
Agreed and apologised for poor the lack of communication.  Agreed predominantly this was down to an individual who is no longer employed by GCH.  Customer has accepted a goodwill gesture and the top up of a disputed amount for damaged goods (£100 total).
"Agreed for a further inspection of the roof at Rudhall court via Garys roofing. JP to attend from an assets POV and inspect if a roof renewal is required. If it is, it can be done this FY. "

Once results of inspections from roof and damp survey are known, remedial actions to be followed up and actioned."
Agreed that all progress updated and any delays are passed to out solicitors in a timely manner so that these can be passed on to Ms Burdett's solicitors
"Agreed that all works had appointment dates , Apology given for the poor communication in relation to the pan issue."
Agreed that GCH were not the agency responsible for taking action regarding noise nuisance from a privately owned property. Signposted to GCC Environmental team. The customer has now contacted them and the case is being investigated. 
"Agreed that GCH will continue to be pro-active in trying manage fly-tipping and inappropriate waste disposal.  Advised him a business case had been submitted for mobile CCTV and we are awaiting a decision.  Once a decision is made, the NM will let him know and see whether mobile CCTV can be deployed.  He had been given accurate information and advice by other team members which is why complaint not upheld."
Agreed that standard of work was not suitable.  Urgent appointments made to rectify and a new toilet seat fitted as a courtesy.  Issues addressed with contractors directly.  Customer satisfied with the outcome after an apology and all rectification works completed.
Agreed that the comparison to Grenfell regarding fire risk may have appeared flippant and apologised for this. Took on board the impact upon the mental health of those involved and agreed that further training could be rolled out across the team.
"Agreed that the extension to her starter tenancy would be cancelled and her tenancy would convert to an assured on the anniversary of her tenancy start date, subject to no other breaches of tenancy being identified."
Agreed that the works identified should have been picked up at void stage. Rescinded recharge which I found to be unwarrented (although this was not mentioned in origional complaint). Have checked all outstanding works have been raised including drains to be cleared (reason for recharge). 2 Doors need rehanging also (this was not part of works missed at void stage). £50.00 compensaations paid for time spent having to wait in for appointments.
Agreed there was no pre termination assessment so tenant was unaware of non-standard fittings.  Agreed these would need to be removed from the recharge list.  Customer accepted the revised amount.
Agreed to arrange for gaarden to have any further rubbish removed which were missed on the first clearance also to cut back front and back including cutting bushes and hedges to help with the maintenace going forward. Spoke to NM to help sort out who will be resonsible for which area of the garden when the new tenant moves in above. All these parts of the resolution have been actioned (please see emails and notes in complaint response). Apologised for the windows above being left open and that we will learn from this.
"Agreed to carry out a temporary repair in the above flats. As a permanant fix we will be installing an external soil pipe as the internal steel pipe has rotted through. As the water leaking was waste water we need to compensate Mr Avery for the 10 x towels, 2 seater sofa and decorating. Mr Avery has taken a lot of time off work to get this resolved and will need to take further time off."
Agreed to ensure all contact methods are explored when communicating with customers. A £50 goodwill payment agreed due to the additional distress this caused and an 8 week delay in a response.
Agreed to fix shower pump on 8/7/22 and give a £50.00 good will gesture for the inconeniance.

Agreed to have an inspection to the property on the 9/12/22 to have the lounge ceiling re-skimmed and painted. Once inspection is complete works will be arranged to be booked in after Christmas.
"Agreed to install a thermostat/temperature monitoring device into customers' property to monitor the data and ascertain if the property is overheating or not. Depending on the outcome of the data, an action plan will be put in place to combat the overheating if appropriate. This was agreed with the tenant (phonecall 30/07/21). Update - monitor was fitted 6/9/21. (Tenant was advised re. delay and was content). Follow up works have now been completed and the resident is happy. "
Agreed to liaise with Servicemaster supervisor to ensure that cleaning schedule is displayed in the block moving forward to evidence attendance. It was also agreed that I would liaise with Property Care/Assets regarding the contractors' housekeeping and rodent issues. Rentokil due to attend 16/6/21.
Agreed to refund the monies once further evidence has been provided. Apologised for not listening/showing consideration and not applying our practices with more empathy.
"Agreed to repaint ceiling and fill holes caused by leak, renew base unit and worktops, plinths. repair front garden path and ensure draining away from front door correctly. agreed to pay for the replacement of the kitchen and hallway floor if quotes are reasonable as they were partially damaged from water ingress from leak and then subsequent removal and as a good will gesture due to poor service. I have agreed also to reamin in touch untill all works are complete.  
1. Inspection of tumble drier (Carried out by Gilmans) - machine found to be working

Works still to be carried out:
1. Kitchen ceiling to be completed - attending 5th September 2022
2. Kitchen base  units  and plinth to be replaced and worktops - 5th/6th September 2022"
Agreed to replace the bath panel and offer a £50.00 good will compensation offer for the inconvinace caused by the leak.
Agreed to supply details of our recommended insurance scheme .
Agreed to weed spray the garden to kill off weed that had grown where decking had been removed. this would take a few visits to kill off. Once this was successful we will tidy garden as a 'one off cut' due to the customer health. Going forward customer will arrange for a gardener to come in and look after. Fencing to be returned to how it was to give privacy. Damp issue identified to being caused by pointing in brickwork eroding. raised works for this are to be reponted.
"Agreed we should not have let the situation drag out for so long. I have admitted this is down to communication as we ordered the units to be replaced but didnt chase up a response and didnt arrange for the plastering issue to be resolved. Arranged for someone to attend tomorrow with me 06.09.22, we will remove the existing kitchen unit, remove mould and replaster the wall. If we can replace/fix the unit there and then we will. Advised if we can not then we have a prebooked timeslot in the diary for the 26th sept to install the kitchen work tops "
Agreed with customer the call was poorly handled and not acceptable.  Apologised to the customer and offered a goodwill gesture of £50 as this is similar to a previously upheld complaint. Details have been sent to employees line manager to review the call with the housing officer involved
"Agreed with tenant to clear the gutter as you can not see a leaf or debris blockage, just a leak which GCH is responsible for. Also agreed to investigate fence post as the neighbours garden is on our radar and we have cleared it previously. Will speak with the NM to discuss the maintenance of the garden as it breaches the tenancy agreement and go from there. "
"Agreed works to be carried out in property and listed in response letter (incl. tiling and filling of holes). Decoration vouchers to be sent out w/c 20/9/21 and tenant to be updated on works not booked w/c 20/9/21 as agreed. Also as per customer request, Midlands are not to carry out any of the works."

The property was not fit for Miss Richardson and her 2yo daughter so the rent she has paid during this period will be refunded. A wardrobe damaged from having to be moved on several occasions will also be reimbursed. Miss Richardson has also incurred extra childcare costs due to appointment needing her present to allow access, these costs will also be met. batroom door to be replaced and touch up painting works around the boxing in of the stack need to be completed."
"All outstanding work has now been arranged with PropertyCare and Assets working closely together to resolve all issues. PropertyCare supervisor is overseeing the job. (5/8/21 - hall ceiling replaster, 9/8/21 - damp specialist visit and 10/8/21 - inspection and various repairs including kitchen units, rear garage door and guttering) "
"All reasonable actions were taken with tenant in the past so there are no specific learnings. However if vulnerable customers appear to be having difficulty resolving similar key issues in the future, a referral will be made to Tenancy Sustainment to see if they can assist the tenant."
All remedials required regarding damp issues which are route cause of mould will be carried out by assests - Waiting on results of heating survey to be carried out on 16/01/2023. Kitchen replacement  (With Assets) to be carried out following damp works. Compensation offered totalling £660. 
All reported repairs with possible H&S implications must be raised as an emergency and completed/made safe with a full report of any FOW required. ST to email operatives and Scheduling to address the concerns 
"All works are being completed 14/3/22 by MBM, I have confirmed their attendance this morning with Miss Squire who is happy work is being completed. Miss Squire has mentioned a mirrir was damaged previously by snape when the original works were carried out. Have agreed to a £50 compensation for the time the works have taken and for the broken mirror. Will be visiting Miss Squire with complaint letter and compensation form 16/3/22 as her emails are not working properly at present."
All works are currently being carried out by LBJ. I have discussed the resolution with the tenant and she is just happy the works are being completed finally. 
"All works are to be fully explained to the customer at the start of a project, any access issues are to be fully explained."
All works have been raised (included in response letter) decorating vouchers offered and accepted. As requested by customer doors will be replaced rather then repaired/adjusted. 
All works raised in complaint now complete to satisfaction of Miss Cooke. 
"Although call outs have been made in the past and actionstaken to clear the drain at that point in time.No investigation of continued problem has been followed up. As pest investations are generally a tenant responsibility, however follow ups with elderly and vunerabletenants should form part of the overall solution offered. Regular review to be held on a monthly basis with Natalie Kirk (Scheduling Team)  of complex/difficult problems incurred"
"Although diaries only offer 3 appointments & in the scenario it could only be a morning one due to the length of time, where we cancel appointment we should always try to adapt to customers needs when rebooking so may move outside of standard slots."
"Although disputed by the former customers issues 1, 2 and 3 were caused by the poorly installed washing machine and although we attempted to repair these when highlighted to uswe were not responsible for them.  the issue in point 4 is disputed by the engineer who attended and there is no way of proving which has been explained to the customer.Point 5 is an error on our part and I have offered my apologies both in the letter and over the phone. Part of the compplaint also highlighted some historical issues 1 the faulty lock has been repaired after an OOH call, they have described the engineer who informed them that the front door was faulty at the void stage but after speaking to the engineer they described he states he told them that there was an issue with the door at the void stage so he got the contractor responsible back who assured us the lock was fine. 2. A repair was carried out on thebathroom door which eased the door no further reports were made about this. 3. Steve L spent a considerable amount of time at the property trying to resolve there issues (even fixing the sink whilst there). An offer was made to carry out the repairs identified. The customer has since moved out of the property and away from Gloucester so we were not given the chance to rectify any issues whilst they were still our customer."
"Although I agree that the customer did have the job cancelled previously due to contractors no longer operating, reasonable attempts have been made to recitify it previously.  The issue has been around access which is still the case.  An offer was made to complete an urgent installation which was declined due to lockdown and lack of available space.  Alternate dates that do work for the customer are being explored and a conversation about a management move will take place. However this is more relevant to the customers overall issues at this location."
"Although it is likely the issue with the leak from the bath waste was a direct result of the tenant's boyfriend/partner working with plaster as part of his job and this washing down the waste pipe, causing a blockage. Agreed with Cape Homes for them to replace the waste pipe and provide a dehumidifier. Also informed resident that Cape had struggled to get hold of her. Also informed residents not to wash plaster down there etc. "
"Although poor workmanship caused the compliant in the long run, this whole situation could have been avoided if the sub-contractor had made contact with the resident and to be fair Ms Middleton had actually said this to me herself. Another issue found was that I believe GCH supervisors and schedulars should have raised a CRM case that could be tracked by the scheduling team /supervisor  to ensure the subcontractors were making contact and that we were chasing this up to ensure our resident was not forgotten about, in hindsight GCH should have managed the problem with the poor workamnship and not relied upon our subcontractor, payement should have been withheld untill a post inspection was carried out which in turn would have put pressure on MBM to attend and resolve the poor workamnship issue. The fact Ms Middleton called in to GCH 2 days after the job was booked in to say it had not been completed and there were issues, this should have been alarm bells for the supervising team and the schedulars, these issues need highlighting and then marked against when signing off subcontractor appllications. I also feel once the failure from MBM had failed to contact the customer the 1st time GCH should have contacted the resident and MBM and booked in a site visit to discuss and agree how the poor workmanship should have been resolved and the agreed timeframe to get the issues resolved. KPI's against our contractors and penalising them in the process.  UPDATE SL - 10-06-2022 - Once the new Scheduling Team Leader starts in July - Reporting mechanisms wil be discussed to enable more consist checks to be made on jobs whether internal or issued to contractors will be traked as they progress. Particular attention for jobs about to expire or have expired on a weekly basis is believed to be appropriate.  Date expected to be enabled September 2022 subject to system capabilities."
"Although repairs have been raised for the mould issues the customer has had to live in these conditions. They have evidenced the damage caused to furniture and have explained the toll it has taken on them with a young baby in the house. Have chased outstanding Jobs for this flat and the block as a whole to try and prevent further issues. Still need to arrange compensation offer and customer has been made aware of this. Have offered decorating vouchers and a further mould wash, the customer is going to get in touch with us when she is ready for this to be carried out as she is currently applying the mould wash herself."
"although tenancy agreement does state that gardens should be kept up by occupier, it is quite vague on details. With this being the case and the tree is causing damage to the pathway (highways) it is best to remove. As this is the case I have partially upheld the complaint"
Although the engineer in attendance carried out the appropriate work to make safew the situation and with in the prescibed timescales. Future call outsof this nature could be made better if bottled water were to be supplied where the resident is left with out running water overnight. Also recruitment of multi-Trade engineers or trainig of exisiting singletrade operatives up to multi -Trade standard would be benificial. With regard to damge caused by the heating installation team a schedule/programme will be supplied giving th eexpected timescales to remidy these shortly. (By end of week commencing  18/03/2022) Compensation and replacement of kitchen ceiling fan/light has been offered.
although the flood was caused by the above flat flushing the toilet 9although informed not to) the problem with the stack should have been dealt with before. Engineers have previously visited and reccomended that the stack be jet washed. A pattern should have also been noted with those raising the repairs as over a period of a year the same sort of issues were raised. 
"Although the letter drop was made on ther day, it may have been more prudent to knock on each door and explain directly."
"Although the property was ready to let, more time should have been given to allow the property to dry out because of the leak at the above flat. Void works also need to meet the GCH void standard before being let. It is also important to explain to Lettings a valid reason why there is a delay in letting. "
Although there was an issue with sourcing the part needed we could have chased fast fix more. A reminder needs to be added to whoever is responsible to chase more frequently. Customer had to sort thereself as they were worried over security as the property is ground floor. Will raise in property care meeting 8/6/22
"Although this complaint should have been passed to planned, I have inspected and agreed to renew the staircase due a very strong and overwhelming smell of urine from previous tenant - this was covered over with gloss at void stage (project void). "
"Although this has been registered as a complaint it in effect reflects an appeal which could reasonably have been considered by Stroud District Council. Given the stringent Local Connection criteria set out in the Section 106 Planning consent by the Horsley Parish, the initial check regarding the criteria threw up some queries regarding working in the locality (and whether full time/part time or primary or secondary employment counted). This was subsequently clarified in dialogue with Stroud District Council who confirmed we were were able to proceed with the applicants consideration for the vacancy at Sealy Wood. The customer viewed the property on Monday 08/07/19 and signed the tenancy on Tuesday 09/07/19 (pre-tenancy and affordability checks had previously been completed). I found that GCH responded in accordance with established practice and Samantha Chesters was delighted to sign up to the tenancy of her new home"
"Although we disagree with certian points raised by the customer it is fair to say due to the weather the cuts have not been to the standard we would like. Unfortunately we have had a sustained period of wet weather and no prolonged dry periods. The grass has never been collected  in the former contract. We took over the contract on the 1/4/23  and cut this area withing the first 3 weeks of the contract, due to the mild but wet conditions we have had this year the gras unfortunately had grown long. "
"Although we test the gas supply annually despite it not being a mandatory task, I will also promote our engineers to ask our tenants if they have any concerns before they carry out a Gas Safety Check. I will also pass some advice on to Zac on how to find a Gas leak with disruption being the last/only option as he is a competent but fairly new engineer. "
although we were not made aware of a couple of the facts - we could of been more proactive & presented different options to the cusomter. 
Always confirm the age of the tenant before assuming they are too young to carry out work at the property
Amend the starter tenancy procedure to make it clearer when a starter tenancy should be extended.
An agreed follow up on the actions set out to ensure that the customer knows which department to contact for a specific issue to avoid a sense of being passed between teams/departments. This information is contained within the area pack information provided at tenancy sign up so no learnings identified. For this particular complaint the initial communication in terms of the direct contact could have been better for which further discussion with the customer provided additional reassurance and peace of mind
An apology has been accepted and assurances given that this is not the standard we expect from our contractors.
An awareness of the underlying housing issues could have averted this issue as it impacted on how the customer was feeling in advance of the contact in terms of the customer service provided by GCH. Also a clearer understanding of the different responsibilities of GCC and GCH in terms of responsibility and accountability for rehousing
Apologised and advised this would be communicated back to the officer during a one to one meeting.
Apologised and discussed complex concerns. Agreed to feedback to Customer Experience Team and make a referral to Enhanced Support Coach for issues raised (Referral made by KS 09/01/23).

Apologised for the delay.  Contractor has been arranged to complete the required works within 1 month
Apologised for the delay. Supervisors did agree a schedule of works which would have resolved the immediate issue but were uncertain if this would resolve it fully without assessing the pipework in other areas. Agreed for surveyor to attend to see if longer term works are required to try and minimize risk of future issues.  Customer was happy with outcome but I agreed to remain the point of contact throughout.
Apologised for the delays and distress experienced. Works to be completed: scaffolding to be erected to remove ivy to side of building and repair and seal all access points; 4 week pest control course to catch and remove squirrel and any other rodents; Inspect and seal access points internally. £150 offered.
Apologised for the poor service delivery of our OOH's provider.  The call was unacceptable which MessageLink have agreed. This has been addressed and they are taking internal steps againt the employee.  He wil no longer be representing GCH if maintaining employment through MessageLink.  Goodwill gesture offered.
Apologised for the service received from the OOH's team.  Enough information was provided to OOH's to refer to the correct contractor whcih caused delay in work being completed.
Apologised for the short notice for the letter drop.  It was required this way due to the security of the sheds which the customer was aware of.  
Apologised to prospective tenant for the standard of the property and for her inconvenience. Sent a bouquet of flowers to her home address. Confirmed rectification works had been completed and procedures are being amended.
Apologised to tenant as we rescheduled due to emergencies received during the day. Call was made to the tenant but the phone was off and the tenant also has no VM facility. Tenant understood and accepts new appointment date of the 22nd Aug
"Apologised to tenant, reviewed the diary with the scheduling team and managed to bring the replacement worktop job forward (from 17/03/22 to 03/02/22).  Mrs Watkins happy with the outcome but was still disappointed with the previous attending engineers comments about how her kitchen sides were dirty. I advised Mrs Watkins it wasnt accpetable and offered a £50.00 good will payment in respect to what shes experienced. Mrs watkins was very happy with our response."
Apologised to the tenant as the meter should not have been capped initially due to the daughter being 21 years old. Offered to compensate for the tenants loss which the tenant accepted plus a £50.00 good will payment. After discussing with S.W i offered double payment for electric heaters as the day the tenant received was the day the electric prices rose.
Apology and reassurance given. Not the standards we would expect from our contractors
"Apology given for engineer attitude, Mr Lewin did admit that he may have been a bit shor with the engineers due to being in pain. Iona to get windows renewed as externally beaded and cockspur handles/"
"Apology given for initial lack of communication (focus was on 19 but this was no excuse). All internal works completed, new fence erected, windows measured/ordered and guttering to be completed by 19/05/21 weather permitting."
Apology given for lack of full explanation re. the installation process and the cistern should not have been left leaking. Agreed to professionally clean and sanitise the carpet and rug.

"Apology issued and works agreed (after tenant cleans the room): re-render cracked outside wall; remove wallpaper from one wall and mould treat; provide redec vouchers. However no evidence that this has been ignored in the past, no phone call recordings. Tenant was concerned about the amount of time it would take to get an inspection carried out - this is due to availability of supervisors - but this is unavoidable. "
Apology issued for call-handling shortcomings and undertook to ensure more telephone training for front line staff. 
Apology issued for poor standards. Lovell to provide a new security light - JP to deliver 24/3. £50 goodwill gesture offered due to issues with TV aerial. Lovell will not pay this £50 gesture so GCH to pay.

Appointing surveys and acting on reccommendations quicker + Communication improvement between PropCare + Asset. 
Appointment already in place for 3rd Jan just over 2 weeks since reporting. Customer has a bath & grab rails already in place.
"Appointment was brought forward several times to try & assist however it got postponed on the day of the appointment due to a job running over.  The work has now been completed.  As the customer took time off, we have offered a Goodwill payment for the incovenience caused."
Appointments have been made in line with the GCH repair policy and we have tried to accomadate the ever growing list of repairs sent to us with the window of opportunity being narrowed by afternoon appointments only being accepted.  When we were made aware of the condition of the property we acted to acknowledge and rectify the situation.
"Appologided for th inconvenience, CX Admin will now scan and email all post to Leasehold manager to ensure Leasehold manager has full time to respond to RTB applications."
Appropriate cooling measures need to be put in place if we are to build properties with non openable windows. See previous complaints about this. 
"Arranged for 2 new rear windows and rear door, and all outstanding repair works (bathroom, stairs, radiator) to be completed 29/3/21. As a goodwill gesture we will board and skim the hall ceiling (at a later date) and have offered £150 for the inconvenience. Referrals also made to Slatters re. defective sockets and to Income Team for support with rent/ESA queries."
Arrangements for payment made. Confirmation that leases are ready for completion
As a reciprocal low level neighbour dispute where neighbourly relations have broken down we have offered restorative mediation support. We have also recognised that on some occasions it's impossible for GCH as a landlord to broker an outcome that is deemed positive for both parties. Given the intractable nature a management move is being considered for the resident of 6 the Retreat to improve the quality of life for both parties (noted that the resident of number 6 has asked this information not to be shared with her neighour)
"As discussed with PC team - appointments to be honoured and if needed to be rescheduled then coomunication with the customer is a must.  Also, ensuring if we are carrying out multiple viists to a property for repairs we need to think outside the box and query with someone to ensure we are looking at alternative solutions rather than just sending poeple out with the same response and the repairs not being addressed "
As part of scheduled visits by ESW tree's need to be identified as problematic or highlighted as they could become problematic in the future. ESW team to be reminded of this at next team meeting (2/9/20).
"As part of the complaint investigation I reviewed the customer call, spoke with the customer by phone to understand her feedback and met with Amanda Hayward via a virtual meetings on MS Teams. Whilst I didn't find that Amanda had been rude in terms of her response, I believe the call could have been handled with more empathy and ownership for taking forward the customer enquiry and to see how the customer was feeling. Amanda was sorry if she had created that perception with the phone call on this occasion and I conveyed my apologies to the customer. I also found that the call which was Repairs related could have been dealt with through Propety Care instead of being onboarded to the Housing Officer, for which I provided feedback to Property Care."
As part of the investigation I attempted to meet with the complainant at his home on three occasions.  The customer cancelled these appointments.  This is a complex case and this customer has one other formal complaint which has been escalated to a stage three hearing.  Being conscious that I wanted to provide a response but having been unable to meet with the customer to receive his feedback as part of my investigation I have sent a response letter and an email which provides an interim review and an opportunity to meet at his convenience when he is feeling better.  Initial investigations with Simon about the customers feedback have at this stage just highlighted concerns about the customer and his interactions with the ASB team.  My response letter has included a number of options for the customer to consider including invoking the community trigger on the basis of dissatisfaction regarding the investigation of an ASB case (under the ASB Crime and Policing Act 2014).
As part of the investigation it was clear that GCH hadn't stipulated a timeframe. Specialist contractors are in place to complete thermoboarding & install datafan extractors.  Work is due to commence on 10th February.  Customer advised he was happy with the actions we are taking.  He is aware that we are still awaiting planinng permission for the external works & windows.  We will also post inspect on 2 occasions after the works have been completed alongside arranging for a surveyor to inspect the windows currently.
"As per complaint 547185. After meeting to discuss issues with Repairs Manager, have implemented new addition to process whereby once job is booked with tenant via telephone, ORCHARD to include entry noting date/time of job and time of contact with tenant. also, any delays in materials will result in a phone call to the tenant advising of latest progress/update on materials"
"As per the Tenancy Agreement and Handbook, patio and driveways are tenants responsbility. This was explained to the customer on numerous occasions and clarified during my site visit on the 12/08/21. 
(I also undertook to chase an OT referral re. the kitchen and raise one re. possible modification to the front driveway and path leading to tenants front and rear doors.)"
"As the initial job carried out by the contractor to clear the blockage was on the face of it successful and the fact that this action moved the problem further down the soil pipes/drainage system, which is why it took three days to back up again. So unless more time is spent checking all runs further down the lines are clear this issue could happen again. Lesson to take forward are that operatives/Supervisors managing these works must make an assessment of the situation on a case by case basis to determine how far the checking of a system should go. This will be dependant on prior history of an issue, the extent of the drainage system network and potential impacts on other properties etc. The best way to manage these will be discussed in detail at next scheduled Supervisors Team meeting (22/09/22). Following this a checklist will be developed to help identify future recurring problems. (To be drawn up and circulated to relevant staff by 30/09/22.)"
"As the initial problems were caused by radiator valves that were of a non-standard type, this caused delay and confusion within the team initially about have to resolve the job as the type of rad valve were not in stock at normal suppliers. The ordering and final supply took far too long and between the initial engineers report and fixing the problem also took far to long. The main problem is that the job was not checked on for progress and therefore the delay in supply of the correct materials was not diagnosed or chased enough. Reports to be run weekly on outstanding jobs with delays above SLA or where materials have been delayed or not delivered within the prescribed limits. Subject to limitations of current systems."
"As the issue of the flooding re-occured on several ocassions and Miss Dawkins had been left with out cold water on the basin tap  for a period of several weeks an offer of £550 compensation has been offered made up of a payment of £400 for replacement flooring and £150 compensation. I have also agreed to replace the bathroom non-slip flooring and replace the damaged bath panel, plus urgently get the cold basin tap turned back on and checked for leaks."
"As the works were completed by the time the complaint was resolved, no further works were required.  However this example of poor appointment process will be on the agenda at the next contractor meeting scheduled for Oct 2022. "
"As there were a lot of legacy issues that had already been resolved outside of the complaints process The learning outcome for this compliant can only be reflective the issues that followed from the poor workmanship to the bathroom. they are as follows:  1.A process for post inspecting subcontractors works of a certain size and value must be compulsory, currently we have a process whereby only a percentage of subcontractor works get post inspected due to resource and they can be of any small to large value. 2. communication, the resident was not kept informed by the subcontractor with regards when they would attend and or if they were coming back to resolve works. going forward our supervisors need to take ownership of jobs passed to a subcontractor over a certain value so the lines of communication do not break down. "
"As this is not a regular occurrence we may need to highlight this on any future correspondence, signage etc."
"Asbestos report has come back negative, so repairs to damaged boxing-in located in the hallway have been arranged on Job ticket 88412-dated 07-01-2022. Whilst timescales (28 days) were adhered to, the tenant did suffer inconvenience and worry so an offer of £100 compensation plus £50 goodwill has been made."
Ashley is going to investigate and understand why it took so many engineers to identify what the issue was and how to fix it. 
"Assessed concerns raised by tenant and agreed that the new bin store area would be monitored over the coming 6 months with GCH addressing any issues accordingly. Estate works are being addressed with Urbaser, GCH contractor for ground maintenance. Regarding access to the property a couple of options were put to customer (altering steps, enlarging privacy fencing) both of which he raised issues with. Advised that forming a ramp/step from the pavement to the property would not be possible owing to the impact on the pavement. "
"Assessed the property with secondary surveyor & agreed to arrange for a structural engineer to review further.  Initial surveyors assessment was not necessarily incorrect but for H&S reasons, further investigation into subsidence has been agreed."
"Asset management had not been made aware of this job until the point of complaint. The quotation from Gary roofing had not been been shared with asset but the job had also been retained in Property Care so asset had no visibility. As soon as IL received quotation, the job was authorised. Tenanr also reported difficulties with CEx team and felt she was not being taken seriously.Tenant had suffered damp as a result of cascading water.  £200 compensation for redecoration, £50 compensation for anciliary costs- telephone, petrol to visit office, letter writing and postage. 9 calls made to GCH of  an average duration of 16 minutes."
Attempt keeping in regular contact whilst part is on order.  Also look at option for providing a temporary heater.
"Attempt to contact Tenant unsuccesfull, letter sent advising we have put measures in place following independant damp inspection on the 14th April 2021. Fan installed, new central heating and advice provided regarding the use of trickle vents on the windows and the extractor fan. An inspection was carried out on the 21st Febuary 2022 following the complaint, this confirmed all measure put in place were not being used and the tenant was currently drying clothes in the property with all vents etc closed. Emailed tenant with the resolution letter sent asking to call back so we can clean the mould off, i also advised the tenant to use the measures in place to prevent anything reoccuring. Advised if tenant needs to dry clothes to use one room that can be well ventilated with a window open and free moving air."
"Attempts made to contact by telephone and door visits, all unsuccessful. Letter sent detailing any reduction in service charges due to closure of communal areas will be recalculated in 2021/22 charges in April."
Attended property to post inspect the window install. I could not see any immediate fault with the installations. The only item that looked like it could perhaps be causing an issue was the window seals on one side. I adjusted these on site so that they fit tighter. Left resident to see if this resolved the issue for her. She confirmed 4 days later that it had. 
"Attended site and agreed to start all outstanding work urgently. Work started 27/03/21 and is due to be completed 07/04/21. Apologised to customer and offered £300 compensation for the delays, distress and significant inconvenience."
"Awaiting structural surveyor's report from visit on 29/03/2023 - expected w/c 10/04/2023, once recieved and reviewed, will update tenant."
Balance of payments made have been transferred to Mrs R Lifelink account and Lucy P to send an apology letter to her for the distressed caused. LA to agree two free months of Lifelink charges (£31.98) to be credited to her on Open Accounts.
Barrier has been repaired and reinforced security has been put in place to stop it being damaged further. Apology issued for distress caused although we were let down by the original contractor so the complaint has not been upheld. New signage has been ordered to be put up in surrounding areas to inform that it is GCH tenant parking only
"Based on the reports and photos relating to the complaint, the lessons to be learnt are to have good communication between different departments within GCH and to resolve any issues before they become a formal complaint (where possible) "
Bathroom ceiling to be insulated and plastered. Full bathroom redecoration in customer choice of colour. Supervisor to monitor works. 
Bathroom is being replaced for number 8 and 10. Tenant was happy with this.
"Bathroom works origionally agreed by  have been honoured as the works need doing  and the customer had been promised these. Other former promises have been honoured as well as customer and our records prove these works have been promised and not honoured.
Can the following works also be arranged for the property –
Inspection of ceiling by entrance to loft (approx 1 sqm of plastering)
Inspection of leak coming from stack by gate.
017113 x 5 - Fencing:Renew or supply new 1.65m timber vertical board fencing, take down existing, remove debris, excavation, set PCC posts at ne 1.80m centres, three rails fixed to posts, vertical boards. (let me know and I will authorise on orchard)

856701 x 1 Light Fitting:Isolate supply, remove and securely refix and reconnect any type of domestic or non-communal light fitting including all tests and make good on completion and remove waste and debris.
840011 x 1 Fan:Isolate/reconnect supply, renew ceiling or ceiling duct fan single speed motor, integral air operated back draught shutter, ne 81 litre/second, electrical tests, make good.
guttering works to be completed 31/5/22"
Be clear with customers on responsibilities (ie GIS/ OT). Ensure customer is aware of any delays
Be clearer with timescales when we update residents regarding delays or changes. I think Ms Davidson misunderstood when she was contacted in November to inform her that works were delayed until the new financial year and she took it that works would be starting the first week of April. Maybe we should should send a letter to back up this information in the future.
"Be consistent with the advice we give out and where possible send out a team member rather than the police, or to try and make contact ourselves. "
Been attempting to contact tenant but no response Popped to property today but they werent in. They had a job booked for hewers to visit yesterday to inspect air source heating but was a no access. response letter sent advising for him to call me so i can do epc and see if any remedial works needed to improve property and said i will get hewers to reschedule in the new year. reminder set for when i am back in office to call tenant if i havent heard anything. 
"Bernice called in to make a complaint she said she needed support with a move as the residents are ignoring her where she lives. She said she had signed on to Home seekers and Homeswapper. She said she didn’t want mediation with her neighbours and wasn’t happy with the way Jade spoke to her when she asked for support for a move. She said that she is having trauma therapy due to her ex-partner being found dead in his flat, and said that she is on suicide watch so felt that she needed more morning calls. Bernice said that she hasn’t seen Jade walk around the building and said she is hardly there"
Better and quicker communication is needed between surveyors and tenants awaiting works.
Better communication - we should have made more effort to contact the tenant to advise of the engineers issues
Better communication and understanding of diverse needs of individuals
Better communication and understanding of needs of individuals
Better communication from contractor about delay & timescales
Better communication from contractor and contractor manager
Better communication from contractor.
"Better communication from IL service, also ensure that that all tenants are contacted and expalined too. "
Better communication needed with all parties throughout similar incidents. We have still not received the fire report re. cause of fire (possible re-charge).
Better communication required between the Manager and the Lifelink team regarding complaints - this  is now an agenda item for the weekly meeting. Manager is now aware that refunds are their responsibility. 
Better communication required from GCH contractor to neighbouring resident. 
Better communication when appointments need to be changed from a GCH perspective.
Better communication with ingoing tenants regarding gardens which are shared with Leasehold properties to avoid any confusion
Better communication with residents about timescales of works and managing expectations. This was quickly resolved following the complaint being made. 
Better communication. Lynne Phillips has been chasing this for months. 
Better documentation of attempted defect visits. Drop in/cold calling is not a valid 'attempt.'
"BH rang tenant 11/9 and subsequently spoke to Lee A re. welfare visit, follow-up Rentokil visit (w/c 14/9) and to speak to tenant later that week. Also referral being made to Community Investment re. helping her obtain a freezer as savings spent. Tenant happy complaint is kept open until resolved.
BH update 02/10 The inspection has been carried out by Rentokil and they have found more evidence of bugs still being there. They will continue to treat and reinspect until there is no evidence of bugs left. The tenant has not been advised to get rid of any further belongings and we are working on getting her a freezer. Complaint to remain open as agreed. "
Biomass system has had multiple outages.  Recent repair has taken place to some pipework which should reduce the risk of ongoing issues. No reference can be found to a previous compensatory payment but have left this open for the customer to confirm further details.  Referral also made to housing officer to discuss a potential move and process required. 
"BM to return to repair scratched floor. Job raised for Slatter electrical to attend and upgrade extractor fans, Job raised for Property care to attend and survey kitchen units with  a view to relocate the tumble dryer. 2 x decs vouchers to be provided for lounge and bathroom decs."
Boiler cover is being sourced for replacement.  Apologised for level of service received and the engineer will be blocked from attending her address in the future.
Boiler manual to be left onsite following a renewal or new resident.
Boiler was repaired within 24 hours as expected for large issue so no failure from GCH. 
"Breakdown in communication between notification to repairs that GCH would not commence work and updating the customer.  Terms of agreement also to be reviewed as they are ambiguous.  Offer made of compensation, alternate garage site and use of GCH vehicle to move has been approved after notice has been served on the garage."
Call back to be comepleted within a reasonable timescale in the future.
"Call back was logged on CRM as a case but the case officer not notified which was why no response.  Clarified with Customer Experience Team that if they take a message, to ensure that the relevant officer is made aware that a callback is required via email or message as it does not autogenerate a message on CRM.  Regular meetings between H&N & CE to resolve minor operational issues like this ongoing."
"Call centre need to be more proactive in asking questions when our customers call in, on this occasion there wasa  blocked sink but not once during the call di the call handler ask if the customer had tried to unblock the sinkl or have the meanms to unblock the sink or even be able to empty the sink. Customer has also been advised that if they need to report a repair in the future they will also need to provide more deatil as it was clear from listening to the call that it wasnt just  a blocked sink as the washing machine waste water was backing up in to the kitchen sink."
Call was disconnected very early on in call where very little had been said and there was no escalation or animosity from any party. Appears to be an intermittent issue with call drops which is already being dealt with by our telephony provider. Customers number has been taken off the main contact system at his request so agent was unable to call him back once the call dropped.
Called customer whose real complaint was why the boiler was not replaced sooner.  History shows that the previous repairs were minor and something GCH would fix rather than replace.  Boiler was PDI'd at earliest time when apparent a replacement was required.
Called private homeowner at 101 hartland road multiple times  but no answer. Spoke with 103 hartland road who advised work was completed on the 16/05/2022. Tenant is happy and neighbour has been okay with her since the repair. Repair was carried out the same day complaint was received. Will close complaint as no further action required
Called tenant multiple times and left VM . rebooked work for 30/05/2022 in the morning after shuffling work about. Job was delayed due to needing more time and having to order posts etc. Will await call back 
"Calls and emails to Ms Church  going unanswered, some discrepencies in messages (2.12.22)"
Calls should be escalated to a line manager should they become difficult. This is to be discussed in the next (monthly) team meeting.
Cancelled and rearranged appointments for repairs.
Cannot replace flooring as she has requested as there is no fault from GCH. A discussion will be had with the engineer to ensure they do not provide incorrect information to tenants
Case closure letter should be clear as to reasons why.  Also evaluate whether case should be closed when issue persisting although not to a statutory noise level. This was discussed with the Neighbourhood Manager on 2nd Feb 23.
Case passed to Tenancy Sustainment 9/4. No easy answer and reponse may take a little longer than 10 days (as provided for in Acknowledgement Letter) until we can find a solution. Customer has been contacted & is aware of the extension. TS team investigating options 27/4 - likely that garages will be demolished as they are beyond repair but customers don't know that yet. Agreed mid-May that rent free weeks will be applied from 23/3/20. Roof cannot be repaired owing to asbestos. Moss preventing liquid covering being applied. Garage options were investigated. Notice given to tenant 18/5. Tenant was spoken to and accepts this but asked for compensation as going on since Jan '19. 29/05. Customer spoken with 29/5/20 and agreed to £50 compensation by way of an apology for the issue with communication.
"Case reviewed with Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader). Last report from the customer on 4th November and limited evidence provided. Also liaised with Lynne Phillips from a Leasehold Management perspective who confirmed that no reports or complaints recieved regarding the flat in question. Provided the customer with detailed advice in terms of City Council in investigating noise complaints cross tenure and the powers they have. Simon to contact Mr Falconer for reassurance in terms of our approach. Noted that Mr Falconer also has reciprocal complaints made against him for loud music on accasions, so I provided mediation as a potential offer if both parties willing to engage"
Catalogue of errors from MD Group. Son has felt his father was taken advantage of by MD Group because he has dementia. IL and Chelsea Milne got MD back the same day as the complaint was raised and issues were resolved. Son is satisfied with the resolution but very unhappy with MD. IL has agreed a process change with MD to ensure thermostats are wired up/programmed during boiler installation. MD to pay £150 compensation to customer.
CCTV survey of drain - Booked with MBM - GCH JN 890988. raise new job to cap off pipe in loft that pest control think is an access point for pests
Ceiling has been replaced and once the drying out process has been completed (approx two weeks) visited to be arranged to assess the damage to plaster on walls etc and arrange fo ramidial works and re-decoration of the bathroom. 
CEx were unable to deal with the call effectively and answer tenants query as information about the repair job that tenant was querying were not on clear on orchard/CRM as to what was happening.  NB to raise with Iona.  
Checking history on orchard for repeat mould wash jobs - and putting a process in place to escalate so that we can implement preventions and educate tenant on managing lifestyle specific to the build type.
Clarification regarding customer expectations to ensure the customer is aware that we operate within legal requirements and have no jurisdiction to prevent customers from smoking within their own home
Clarify the different roles provided by GCH as a landlord and the Local Authority when investigating whether there a statutory noise nuisance
clear and up to date communication need when offering repair solutions.
Clearer information during the sign up process may potentailly avoid this.
"Closer monitoring of Cleaning service incorporating  standards, quality, VFM. The complaint was justified in terms of the cleaning within the block which was not up to standard. Issues raised with Contractor and weekly audit checks to be implemented by the Contracts Manager with regards to work on site meeting standards as defined by the contract specification & noted/advertised within the communal area of the block.       "
"CM rang 22/9 in absence of NB to ensure tenant aware she wasn't being ignored. 
NB Spoke to tenant. Fence to be erected next Saturday. The other works to the patio will be completed following this by our contractor. Snape had tried on a few occasions to make contact with tenant regarding the mould washing. She is to advise when it will be ok for them to enter the property - it will then be booked in."
Communal area and flats were cold during extreme cold weather we had. All heating in communal area working fine and did epc on tenants flat. All performing in the good range. No moisture to external wall in tenants flat. Made schem manager and ILM aware in the future if we have a cold spell like recently to call the office and have temp heaters dropped off for duration needed. Have told tenant to call office to arrange for temp heaters also and we will reimburse the cost if necessary. 
"Communication  - As mentioned prev, alot of the works the tenant was complaining about had been raised, perhaps the issue could have been escalated sooner to a supervisor who could have visited and raised relevant works first hand "
Communication and ownership around works. Notes on systems to be improved
Communication barrier between GCH and contractor has been addressed.
Communication between engineers to ensure that customer expectations are clear.
Communication between front facing team in this case (customer experiance and scheduling) to notice when a manager has failed to contact a customer even when they have stated they would.
Communication between teams was too focused on emails and lacked the appropriate follow up and ownership to ensure that key outcomes such as the inspection were delivered on time.
"Communication bewtween GCH and customer needs to be improved, alos our subcontractor MBM completed theri works but did not feed back to GCH and we did not post inspect leaving the job incomplete and further frustrating the customer "
"Communication from call centre to customer has been poor, records of job visits have not been kept uptogether also and this has caused the resident to feel tha tthey were not being listened to and leaving them in a state of limbo as nobody seemed to have clue as to what repairs the customer had been waiting on to be actioned. - clearer communication between scheduling and CX needed to understand what  stage a particular job is at and also to not state to customers that they dont have a record of the job without 1st looking into it and or offering to call them back once they ahve looked into it, i proved that there was very limited information of this job, however there was something and from that and communicating with the customer i started the ball rolling again to get to where we are now."
"Communication is key to doing what GCH does. Even if there are delays, customers have a right to be told and expectations managed. Customers to be told what the works involved are and how many visits this might take."
"Communication is key to doing what GCH does. Even if there are delays, customers have a right to be told and expectations managed. Customers to be told what the works involved are and how many visits this might take. Different use of IT systems havenothelped keeptheclarity of what has gone wrong with previous attempts to resolve the situation. Better cross team sharing of information and checking of details "
Communication needed to be clearer regarding appointments.  This has been fedback to the development team.
"Communication needs to be improved both by the operative and by the cx team. Plumber shouldnt be telling a tenant it will be an emergency for a contractor, it should be fed back to scheduling first. We should try not to imply to tenant that they are lying if that is what was said, as its one word against the other, instead a return visit should be arranged or asked to send images in the first instance. "
Communication on updates to inprove and put togethere Fact Sheet on DFGs
"Communication to the tenant could have been better as alot of his queries were from previous works carried out, i.e the inspection to his heat pump and not relayed back to him. It may prevent things building up and leading to a complaint in future. "
Communication within the development process to ve more visable for new residents - as discussed with Daniel Lutman
Compensation offered for goods damaged by mould  - total £320
Compensation to be paid for the accidental damage to the customers table (engineer knocked into it with toolbox).
Complaint caused as tenant had to call in to chase a response. Apologised to tenant and assured that measures are in place for a call back to be actioned. Have asked Neighbourhood Manager to call tenant to discuss issues and provide further updates. Also provided information about the Community Trigger.
Complaint closed due to no contact from customer
"Complaint co-ordinated by Barry Rees (Tenancy Services Team Leader) due to being absent on annual leave. I wrote to the customer to this effect on  22/05/19 as a courtesy. JH. Stage 1 response sent, complaint not upheld. Advice given to complainant to contact other professional agencies who may be able to assist. BR"
"Complaint not upheld as numerous recorded attempts have been made, documented and corresponded with Tara on. She has agreed that she has been a no access on numerous times but called NKS in December to book. Casa inspected and surveyed 2nd week in January. Following receipt of the absestos survey, NKS will book in. Advised Tara that she will need to be present and allow access as per her tenancy."
"Complaint not upheld, and I'm satisfied that GCH provided as much help and support as was possible to assist. Therefore no lessons to be learnt on this occasion."
Complaint not upheld.

Complaint rescinded when Faisal Gondal spoke to customer 1/9/21. (But email response to be sent as agreed)
"Complaint rescinded. Customer just wanted some action taken and this is now in hand (gas quote being obtained from Wales & West, OT assessment being arranged, HO looking at request for move)."
"Complaint responded to without cust interaction as would not take calls nor answer emails. Miss Meredith has had two visits from geotechnical enegineers who have said there is no issue with the garden sinking and it lies at the lowest point of the road so water will naturally accumulate. Suggestion of removing all top soil and turf and relaying both may offer a minor improvement but engineer felt it wouldn't. Have agreed with neighbourhood manager that we will not engage further specialist opinions on this matter. Window- not due for renewal til 2030 and stock con'd by MH in Se 2021. However, a number of broken handkes, misted units would not make repair cost effective. Placed on programme mid Nov with caveat that we would await geotech reports. NWD tried to survey 3 times (according to NWD) but was no access. Issued with NWD supply chain and labour meant planned programme was not completed. I had spoken to HM in March and said it was unlikely that NWD would get back round to her but would put on to Anglian which she accepted. Kitchen- SCS 2022 renewal, is on MD programme and MD will contact in due course. I had investigated last year whether it would be able to move forward but due to MD resourcing and staff turnover it wasn't."
Complaint response date was extended to allow customer to obtain further repair estimates. GCH will pay for preferred quotation from Mon Motors (£582) - compensation form/payment now processed. 
Complaint response referred to Barry Rees (Tenancy Services Team Leader) to investigate on 31/07/19. Interim correspondence forwarded to the customer on 31/07/19 to confirm that Barry would be overseeing due to being on annual leave. Complaint concerns neighbour smoking in his flat and smoke is coming into the flat below. Arranged for Surveyor to visit with Housing Officer so visual inspection can take place. Barry actioned the response on 06/08/19
Complaint response referred to Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) to investigate on 31/07/19. Interim correspondence forwarded to the customer on 31/07/19 to confirm that Simon would be overseeing due to being on annual leave. Simon actioned the response on 06/08/19. Resident raised concern that the neighbouring property was not safe following a flood. There is ASB being reported involving visitors to the address. Property Services have advised that the property is safe and remedial works are being completed. ASB & Tenancy Services have visited the neighbour and discussed a number of tenancy concerns. Follow up visit to be completed. 
"Complaint reviewed in full with Housing Officer. There is no evidence to uphold the complaint. Offer to the customer to meet with myself to ascertain if there are any underlying issues and also to meet jointly with Housing officer in order that we move forward positively. Also offered mediation services through Restorative Gloucestershire as part of my response. Copy of tenancy agreement forwarded to customer, although no records of the request having previously been made. JH"
complaint taken by TSO from complainant about the lack of action taken by the ASB team over ASB issues and support for the family
"complaint via ombudsman. Ms Douglas has been in contact with us regarding a complaint about Gloucester City  Homes (the Association) and the way it has dealt with adaptation works in her home. Particularly, Ms Douglas has noted that she feels the Association has failed to undertake adaptation works previously agreed over 3 years ago. We have explained to the complainant that the Ombudsman Service seeks to encourage the parties to reach a resolution themselves, through the appropriate local procedures (such as the internal complaints process) and cannot consider
complaints which have not exhausted a landlord’s complaints process. Ms Douglas advised she last submitted a complaint to the Association’s Chief. Executive in March 2018, and she informed it was agreed that the adaptation works would be completed however, they remain outstanding to date. Based on the information provided, it is not clear whether Ms Douglas’ complaint has been considered formally by the Association. If the complaint has not exhausted your internal complaints process, we would ask that you contact Ms Douglas within 15 working days, to confirm whether she has a
formal complaint with the Association and if so, what stage the complaint has reached. If Ms Douglas has not raised a formal complaint about the matters, please provide her information on her options should she remain dissatisfied with service received from the Association. If the matters mentioned have been considered and completed your complaints process, please provide us a copy of your final response."
"Complaint was fundamentally in relation to recharges.  Previous investigation by Stacey Jellyman was a correct reflection of the charges.  There was no pre-term completed and the complainant wanted me to review the issues with heating prior to Xmas.  Again, whilst theer were mitigating circumstances, GCh were not without any form of fualt as we could have taken more ownership with assistsing a vulnerable tenant.  With this is mind I have agreed to reduce some of the charges as a goodwill gesture based on the tenant tenure."

"Complicated case with a history of access issues.  We have made several attempts to resolve previously including outside of office hour apppointments which the customer has not kept.  I have advised we have taken reasonable attempts to rectify however I have marked the complaint as partially upheld as we could have made further attempts to contact the customer but the evidence does not suggest this, instead leaving it in the customers court to contact us.  I have supplied a date during October half term to survey the property in all its guises advising that we can't proceed unless access is given but have given my name as the single point of contact until completion.  "
"Confirmed that supporting information had been provided to Homeseeker who would assess application.  Customer bidding.  Struggling with stairs - agreed to put in at OT referral to see if additional handrails could be put in communal area.  OT referral done.  Previous ASB cases unproven however customer says arguing and shouting continuing - more concerned about what is happening in the household.  Agreed that a new ASB case will be opened and passed to the new NM to investigate and see if there is ASB or other issues. Advised that new NM starts at GCH on 15 November so ASB case would be opened after that, which she was happy with."
"Confirmed with Ashley chapman, no lessons learnt in this instance"
"Consider the use of specific language when speaking to customers. Whilst referring to Grenfell is done to highlight what could happen if fire risks are not identified and eliminated, it can be triggering for some and can impact on underlying mental health concerns. Learnings regarding Tone of Voice are to be reported back to the teams following the Housing Services restructure."
Considerate & sensible parking should be used at our blocks.  We are sometimes restricted on access however a  tool box talk has been agreed for this particular scheme for a sensible parking option.  This will be fed in to our contractors also.
Consideration to be given to making a second attempt to contact the customer if unable to reach the first time when rebooking. This has been discussed with the Team Leader and will be brought in to the next team meeting. Lack of action has been discussed with the relevant supervisor and a new inspection has been booked.
Consultation needed with contactors to ensure they work to the standards that are expected whilst in Customers homes.

Contractors and repair operatives need to be informed no works should begin before 8am unless an emergency. Also we need to make sure notices are put in communal areas informing customers of planned works in communal areas as well as in individual units within a communal block/building. Repair operatives will be reminded of this is their next 1-2-1's  and via email. Email sent to contractors as well as informal discussions via phone by repairs supervisors.
"Contractors have admitted it was a mistake.  An urgent appointment was arranged, apology was made by the contractors and a goodwill gesture made of flowers and a gift voucher directly by them.  Surveyor addressed the issue immediately and adressed with the contractor."
Contractors have subbed this out to a 3rd party.  They have managed it internally to ensure contractors and any subsequent 3rd parties doing the work on their behalf maintain the standards as agreed to within the formal contract with GCH.
Contractors need to follow GCH Tone of Voice and customer liasion guidance. GCH Tone of Voice document sent to MD Group. Rob has been on annual leave this week but Kiran will speak with him about his conduct on his return.
"Contractors need to have a firm policy on making contact with tenants if appointments cannot be fulfilled. Iona to have a discussion with Nationwide. Face to face meeting to be held with Contracts Manager (and IL), followed by conversation with the Regional Manager."
Contractors to always obtain written permission prior to causing any damage i.e. cutting carpets around fixed furniture.  Toolbox talk also taking place with them regarding professionalism whilst on site.
Contractors went against access instructions which impacted on tenants' son being able to move the belongings of his deceased father.  Apologised to tenants' son and have offered to redirect the post over the next week as requested.  
Contractors will no longer be supporting GCH work in the future.
Control centre must follow instructons on system for each individual customer. Operator should have contacted duty Reponder and not the named contacts. All staff not to make assumptions when dealing with emergency calls.
"Converssations relating to black mould need to be more considered, partiulalry in light of learnings from RBH."
Cooker to be delivered 18.04.20. Apology issued and training identfied for staff member. 
Correct operative needs to be assigned to jobs so we can get the problems sorted without returning. Although opertive denies saying he was an odd job man a reminder to all operatives about proffesionalism will be mentioned during W.O.R.K reviews and team meetings going forward.
Correct process for managing damp and mould now in place since February 2022. Joined up approach being taken between PropertyCare and Assest team to resolve these potential damp and mould issues before they escalate.
"Correct process had been followed for repairs however, there did appear to be a communication issue from a subcontractor that implied a replacement door would be forthcoming.  No immediate need for a door but due to mobility issues an Urgent OT Assessment has been requested.  Schedule of works has been agreed for all outstanding repairs."
Correct processes followed.
could have been addressed differently at point of first calls through to CEX team as was a recent void in the first instance it should have been referred back to the void team and we could have taken this route and not incurred a complaint 
Cusotmers complaint was more historic.  The only breakdown since her last compaint was due to the radiators needing bleeding which is common after having heating off for a period of time.  I have agreed to place courtesy calls in to the customer over the next few months to ensure it there are no issues. 
"custmer experiance team need to ask customer about mobility when asking them to change their own lamps, the customer in this instance has various health conditions and this was not picked up either by viewing a UDC or asking basic questions, it was also not picked up that the light repair was initially an emergancy but when it could not be repaired during that initial visit when it was booked back in was a 28 day repair, this should have been another emergency fitted on to slatter ekectricals diary for as soon as  possible onc ethe poarts had arrived in."
Customer advised on phone that the issue was resolved.
Customer advises she had been absuive to Martin. Customer had been advised not to burn the laminated timber due to presence of copper azoles which have toxicity. Reiterated in letter.
"Customer agreed the complaint could be closed on the basis that we would take action as necessary after the visit (arranged to suit her diary). 
Post visit note – we have filled the visible holes but should have looked in a bit more detail. On this occasion, whilst pest control is normally a tenant responsibility, I have raised pest control to look and confirm where I think they may be entering. The customer is doing all she can to resolve the issue so it is only fair we support her in this."
Customer claimed she was advised 2 years ago that the kitchen would be replaced by subcontractors.  No evidence to agree with this.  Kitchen was recently inspected & we have now agreed to replace the kitchen which ahs been passed to Glevum as a priority & has already been surveyed.  The customer also had several repairs whcih we have addressed in the complaint response too and arranged for them to be completed.
Customer complained about the attitude of the staff member who he spoke to about the arrears letters he had received. 
Customer complained that she was entitled to have a POD attached to her property after an assessment by Kenny Thomson. She advised that she had been ringing for the past year to get an update on the situation but was not getting any specific answers or update on the position.
Customer did not really know how he wanted his complaint resolved so it was agreed that I would speak to the person who had made the comments to let them know how it had made the customer feel. Also made referral to Tenancy Sustainment re a query raised.
Customer did not require a formal response as she was happy with the actions taken. A priority treatment by Rentokill was arranged which also included neighbouring properties. An environmental clean was organised by Servicemaster and all holes were filled and made good afterwards.  A recall was raised for Servicemaster (as areas had been missed) alongside further make good works for poor workmanship. This was post-inpected by the PropertyCare Manager and signed off by the customer. She confirmed she was happy with the outcome. Compensatory amount £867 was agreed to go towards customer expenses prior to GCH decanting them.
"Customer experienced difficulty in getting a satisfactory repair completed at her property which resulted from a leak from the flat above. She has waited in for appointments when no body has turned up, resulting in time off work and loss of earnings. This has also impacted on her sons health. "
"Customer felt that the process for having repairs done to wet room/fan/tiles and decoration was too long, and that she wasn't kept informed with what's happening"
Customer had appointment cancelled or rescheduled twice.  Whilst the customer was aware that this may occur she was not communicated with.  Apologised for the lack of communincation and confirmed she had 2 appointments now booked.
"Customer had been concerned about H&S issues with parking at the rear of Clapham.   It had previously been agreed by the scheme manager and directors for all engineers and contractors to park at the rear due to parking issues,  We have agreed instruct our engineers to park in a triangular area that is not an obtruction to the public &/or fire service.  Courtesy call to take place after 1 month."
"Customer had misunderstood what was stated in terms of safety, but this was subsequently discussed with an assurance given that it was safe. Complaint was upheld due to delays in removing an historic issues with asbestos (although this was completed safe and sealed). Works prioritised (toilet removal) for an urgent resolution."
"Customer had misunderstood what was stated in terms of safety, but this was subsequently discussed with an assurance given that it was safe. Complaint was upheld due to delays in removing an historic issues with asbestos (although this was completed safe and sealed). Works prioritised (toilet removal) for an urgent resolution."
Customer has been without heating or hot water for two months due to a faulty boiler.
Customer has carried out works herself and no longer requires the job to be complete. Have spoken to her on the phone and agreed to visit later in the week to talk about other repairs that need doing.
Customer has consistently reported repairs required to the fence at the adjoining property. Despite assurances that something would be done the matter is yet to be resolved. 
Customer has had an ongoing issue regarding water penetration from a neighbouring property for several years.  This has not been aided by the fact the Leasehold property is void for long periods and difficult to reach.  Work had already commenced when I called the customer and a plan is in place to rectify her property once the work is completed. (Visit booked 26/11). I have also offered a goodwill gesture which the customer was very happy with.
Customer has refused the weighted shower curtain as she doesn't like it as it is white. The curtain would undoubtedly help with the situation. Michelle from MD to supply and fit one on Monday 4th October. Customer states that white is dirty and she will not use this after 7 days. Explained to customer that the weighted shower curtain is required for use in a level access shower and this was explained by Laura Carroll and MD but customer has refused to allow this to be installed. Michelle from MD has visited previously and found the drain blocked with hair. The installation/gradient of the shower tray has been confirmed as correct.
"Customer has signed up with a supplier and has no gas appliances, but is receiving an standing charge.  Meter was in the property when tenancy began and no reference to GCH accpeting cost.  Customer will look at changing supplier to a new suppplier."
Customer is aware of the reasons why it occurred. Urgent appointments were offered plus Saturday attendance which the customer declined.  Agreed appointment is place 28/07/2020 am. which she is happy with.  Outcome was that one of the temps had not checked the history fully before rebooking which has now been picked up in training.  The customer was happy with the straightforward response - it was all discussed over the phone.
Customer is unhappy about an outstanding repair and timescales around completing the job. Operative was unable to fix first time and there appears to be a delay in completing the repair.
Customer is unhappy about he process around no access for electrical testing. Despite access being gained the customer still had to go through the court process and as a result has incurred charges.
"Customer is unhappy about the length of time it took for a repair to be completed. Repair was on a bedroom ceiling which contained asbestos and customer was told it would be 1 month before the repair could be completed. When date arrived for repair it could not be completed in one visit as it had not been allocated enough time or resource, resulting in a second appointment."
Customer moved in during late October via a mutual exchange. Scaffolding had already been erected recently however the new PropertyCare Manager had inspected and advised it was down to the customers lifestyle and there was little to no evidence of a water ingress. Surveyor attended as a second opinion and advised it was possible that some small defects in the pointing were letting in water. He also found no evidence of a water ingress which ties in with the PropertyCare managers visit. We agreed to commence with the repointing as the scaffolding was already up. I have left channels open for the customer should mould return but have supplied a condensation leaflet also.  We have agreed that as we are coming in to warmer months this may not happen for another 6 months but they could come back to me at any point.  Complaint not upheld as I am confident we have followed all reasonable processes throughout
Customer reported that the boiler in his property was dangerous and he had been advised not to use it. He was unable to use the boiler so had no hot water or heating.
Customer rescinded complaint by telephone 18/3/20 (Matt Dunne)
Customer rescinded complaint. Spoken to 5/3/20 and issues resolved.
Customer rescinded formal complaint.  She did not require a formal response after investigation had taken place & understood how the events occured.
Customer rescinded formal complaint.  Work has been completed & in the future she will ask to speak to a member fo the repairs team or get a job number if she comes into the office to report a repair.
Customer rescinded formal complaint. He did not require a formal response as works have now been completed.
Customer service standards need to be reiterated to all contractors .
Customer service team to be clearer on lead times for call back requests.  They must be mindful if people are available before offering this out to the customers.
Customer should have received written notification advising it was part of a planned programme of works and of next steps.  A new suite of letters encompassing this is being designed when our new contractors are onboard.
Customer waited 5 weeks for a basin to be replaced. An appointment was arranged and then the contractor didn’t turn up.
"Customer was offered a property, undertook viewing etc. and the  offer was withdrawn"
Customer was refused a car park barrier pass to allow her son access at Clapham Court.
Customer was unhappy about receiving a letter from a solicitor chasing former tenant arrears without previous correspondence from GCH.
Customer was unhappy about the standard of the void property she moved in to. Despite raising issues at post-let visit nothing was done to rectify them. 
Customer was unhappy about the way her repair request was dealt with. She experienced difficulties arranging the appointment and eventually was given two different times that the engineer would call. The customer stayed in all day until 4pm when she had to leave for 10 mins to pick her husband up. During this time the engineer called and were advised by the customer's son that she would be home shortly. The engineer refused to wait for the customer to return which resulted in rebooking the appointment. 
"Customer was unhappy at not being listening to on original call when reporting repair. tenant has many years of experience within the building trade and was happy to offer advice on timescales but was not listened to. customer was just upset that he had to move his furniture around on 2 separate occasions, especially as he is disabled/arthritic. Good communication was not on display here. final resolution was to ensure that a supervisors scope of works visit is made before any engineers attend, to ensure that the correct SOR codes are allocated, the correct amount of time is allocated and that the correct materials are ordered to assist with our fixing on first attendance aim. "
Customer was unhappy that despite previous issues with pet ownership we had allowed her brother-in-law to have another pet in the property. This has resulted in a situation which will be very stressful for him due to mental health issues and the current condition of his property.
Customer was unhappy that they were refused access to park in the disabled parking spaces at Railway House.
Customer was unhappy with the approach and attitude of the gas engineer who visited her property. Her gas cooker was condemned but the reasons were not explained.
Customer word against GCH word. Customer does not dispute there may have been an animal dropping but does dispute it was all over the house.  Customer wanted specifics from the engineer about where it was spotted but they were off on long term sick. Agreed to remove engineer from attending address as a courtesy.
Customer states that he did not respond when the Fire service arrived and that he had left the appliance unattended.
Customers are not fully aware of the policies in regard to the age of the person who can be present when a repair is being carried out. Perhaps a brief message on our website to reiterate the information may be beneficial.
Customers complaint was about delays during lockdown which were outside of GCH's control.  We have acted as fast as possible with repairs and the claim he was not contacted by a surveyor was incorrect as he confirmed he had been. He also claimed about the missing remibursement for temporary heaters (late 2019) but made no reference to this - however I have offered the £10 requested as a goodwill gesture.
Customers complaint was reasonable we are unable to guarantee stability of systems so no lessons learnt.
Customers concerns need to be listened to more. When complaints are around contractors works we need to investigate and make sure they are put right. This needs to be followed up to make sure the works are completed to the agreed standard.
"Customers need to be listened to regarding the works needed , this lady was frustrated as the delay could of been avoided."
Customers real concern was over a recharge.  This has stemmed from some confusion between her son & our engineer over what work was required.  I have marked it as partial as our engineer may not have been fully briefed on what was required however as it transpires there was a water ingress through the flue.  I have agreed to remove the recharge from the account.
Customers to be advised that we can not raise a complaint in regard to issues that have not been reported.
CX amin will now scan all applications and emial them to LH Manager. Additional lessons learnt on closed group.
"CX team and scheduling team need to be looking at job history and noticing patterns when the same job keeps coming up on their radar, the team also need to familiarise themselves with the different types of heating system that we have in our portfolio.

Looking at repair history needs to be a must when raising a job, just to give a snapshot of when the last job was raised for that property, it could save resource from wasted visits and offer a better service in the long term."
Damp issues have been ongoing here since 2016 and several attempts have been to resolve the issue. It was agreed with customer that we would get a damp report done by Dave Taylor (independent) and follow the guidelines given there.
Damp survey of property carried out 3/12/21 which outlines actions needed to be taken to deal with damp/mould issues in property. These will be followed and jobs have been raised (dates tbc). Damaged carpet and flooring to be replaced - quote received and accepted and works booked in for 16/12/21. Job raised to inspect insulation and rectify if necessary. Compensation offer of £250 for other items damged due to mould/damp.
Dan Lutman already aware of this issue from the first contact made by the tenant and resolved. 
Dan Lutman was aware of the issues with the airsource heat pumps on these new builds. Due to the unusualy cold weather they were not performing to standard. Dan had lane britton jenkins (contractor) out to fit new buffer valves to all the airsource heat pumps. These have been completed. I spoke with Dan Sadler for the correct usage of the heat pumps and he has advised they work best when set to a comfortable temp and left on perminently. It costs less to do this than turn it on and off when they are cold. I have advised this in the response letter. 
Dealt with under DP processes
Decorating vouchers for a 2 bedroom flat as a goodwill gesture along with garden works. 
Decoration vouchers for his bathroom and repair works have been arranged. 
Delay in fitting was due to a bespoke stairlift that required installation.  Customer understood the reason why it took longer however this was not communicated at any point & she was advised it would have already been completed.  She has an appointment today from a TPG surveyor & she is happy how it be managed afterwards.  I confirmed I will personally monitor through to completion.
"Delay in repsonse due  to waiting for Miss Leach to obtain quotations for various items she wished to be included in the complaint. As identified in the response letter there are various items that need to be followed up .Following my investigation of recent events I can confirm I have investigated the following and included my recommendations/resolutions to move these issues forward as quickly as possible:
•	Kitchen Upgrade – Not heard anything since but previously told by a surveyor that Miss Leach could have one 
Requirements for additional cupboards and shelves that cannot be reached to be altered
And requires more worktop space 
I will report back and request an update on the O/T referral that was made and recorded on the GCH CRM system - case 23165 -B5N5H1 dated 09/08/2021
•	Dishwasher Position – Owned a dishwasher for 2 years but cannot use due to position in kitchen and is required due to ongoing serious health conditions
I will report back and request an update on the O/T referral that was made and recorded on the GCH CRM system - case 23165 -B5N5H1 dated 09/08/2021
•	Smell left from sewage leak
On both visits I was unable to detect any odour, however I recognise that you had taken steps to neutralise these over a prolonged period. 
With the old flooring being replaced and disposal of damaged items I believe this will remove any lasting odours, however once all of the works have been completed if you notify me, I would be happy to return if the odour has not dissipated to your satisfaction.
•	Leak in bathroom – 
Issue resolved - No longer present
•	WC – New seat required suitable for disabled person
Requirement for new W/C seat to be referred to occupational health for a specialist recommendation and I will include in new occupation report being requested as stated below.
•	Shower not up to pressure
On check in the existing shower was working as intended, however the previous shower may well have produced more pressure. If this is still an issue then it would need to be referred to occupational health for a specialist recommendation and I will include in new occupation report being requested as stated below.
•	Broken tiles in Kitchen
New job to be raised to replace broken tiles
•	WC not flushing properly 
On inspection WC flush operated as it should. 
•	Rotten skirting board and door architrave in bathroom
Job to be raised to renew and fix
•	Damage suffered to the following due to the sewage flood:

o	Large throw
o	Damaged paintwork
o	Dresses x 2
o	Bathroom mats 
o	3 towels"
Delays in works being completed need to be communicated promptly with the custor to prevent confusion or frustration.
Delays need to be communicated with residents and supervisors promptly
"Developers have been trying to get in touch since Feb via phone, texts and email with no luck. Confirmed number for Developers so tenant can get in touch with them."
"Development team to look at air cooling measures where possible, if further developments are proposed with windows that do not open. "
Difficulties in sourcing the Kitchen led to the delay but no contact was made with Mr Newman throught to explain this from the voids team or MBM. Their was also an issue with the Mr Newman telephone but there were other ways we could have communicated (I contacted independent living manager). I will discuss this lack of communication with the voids team and repairs manager so they can learn lessons from this.
Discussed complaint with tenant and job has been arranged for 23rd November for all outstanding works. Tenant happy with this and Dan and Leila will monitor to ensure this goes ahead.
"Discussed the meter issue seemed to be lack of communication as Letting confirmed they advised him to ring his supplier when he moved into the property.  Hold up was on his suppier end not ours. The excess voltage is great western powers responsibility and all our electric checks were correct ( Electrical manager has reviewed this case). Have signposted Mr Sawkins to Redwell centre for help with food vouchers, I arranged this with community centre manager who is expecting him."
Discussion to be held with Governance regarding vexatious nature of complainant as the response to this complaint is what was provided re. complaint ref. 547004.
Discussion with Slatters to ensure they are fully confident an issue has been resolved before closing a job. 
Discussions held with tenant. GCH to contact neighbour to advise that customer didn't make complaint against them. Confirmed no offence was meant by the inappropriate remark made during staff visit. Confirmed OT referral made/supervisor visit to be booked to resolve tap noise/new fan in bathroom to be requested.
Dispite previous visits and reports of mould and damp issues by GCH nothing was implemented to remedy these issues. There is now a new process that has been developed between Repairs and Assets to ensuredamp/mould issues follow a progressive escalation process. Completed April 2022
Dispite previous visits and reports of mould and damp issues by GCH nothing was implemented to remedy these issues. There is now a new process that has been developed between Repairs and Assets to ensuredamp/mould issues follow a progressive escalation process. 
"Disrepair' case not upheld as such due to our Orchard/DRS records not showing that all of these jobs have been previously logged to us. However, upheld in the sense that these jobs are required. "
Door entry system was repaired and Mr Tynan was happy with the outcome.
"Door has been replaced so have offered an apology for the time its taken for these works and £1,000.00 compensation"
Door took too long to source & replace.  Door has subsequently been replaced & the customer is happy with the standard of workmanship
"Door works have been arranged- 13th and 14th July
Other repairs have been arranged - 12th July"
"Due to a previous written agreement made between an ex-staff member and the customer, I agreed to arrange for a quotation from Property Care to look at getting the fence put in. In the meantime, I requested that customer continues to engage with both the ASB Team and Environmental Health to address any further incidents with his neighbour. Simon Turner is aware and will be looking to provide a qutation for the works in due course."
"Due to the construction of the property and amount of water that has leaked from the flat above, it is taking a long time fo the water to stop dripping into customers kitchen. Another visit is arranged for 5/1/22 to assess the damage/monitor progress. Once the dripping is confirmed as stopped, some time will be required to allow the property to dry out. At that point a full assessment of the damage caused will be made. Meantime assurances have been given that the ceiling will be repaired and decorated, kitchen walls units affected by the water will be replaced with as close as possible to the exisitng units within reason. It is hoped to reuse unit exisiting doors, as yet not affected by water damamge. Compensation of £550 offered + £50 goodwill given the duration of the leak/dripping and inconvenience."
"Due to the customer need to cross lounge to access bedroom, self levelling the lounge floor was not viable so agreed to supply a flooring voucher to the sum of £400 to be used at Gloucester Carpet outlet. PO number has been issued. Window has been inspected and 2 x tilt and turn friction hinges have been ordered - awaiting delivery. Once in stock the appointment will be raised to repair."
Due to the period of time elapsed from when these issues were first raised and the circumstances surrounding the customers health it is hard to attain what went wrong here. There are also no records of what has and what has not been agreed previously when a former property care supervisor attended. 
duel response sent via email upholding the complaint.
During a conversation between the customer and Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) on Weds 24/07/19 to invite Jade Earwaker to RWH or arrange a home visit she advised she didn't want this progressed as a formal complaint. I wrote to the customer by email to this effect on 26/07/19 and confirmed her request and that Simon would address the response as part of a routine customer enquiry
"During the Home Visit - Mrs Dowles advised that she did not intend to complain about any member of the IL team or the service recieved. She is frustrated at the ""system"" since the changes to the service. She advised that when she is experiencing poor mental health, she emails or send a letter which she ordinarily wouldn't.We discussed her concerns relating to menatl health and i agreed to liaise with the team and make an ILC referral. Agreed to report repair for her."
During the last couple of weeks we had seen this was an issues with CEX team and we have opened up the lettings info to them now and we have provided training on how to access and provide this to tenants and prospective tenants 
Earlier assessment from a surveyor & more prompt decision for a management move would have been more effective however this was only promped by the complaint.

Emailed customer twice as no contact number.  Email stipulated that if no contact was made by 20/03/2020 then we would close the complaint.  Contact has been made and this currently being managed outside of the complaints process as informal.  Complainant is running the Coronavirus ward at GRH so is difficult to be in contact with but may revisit if neccesary.
"Emails received where it is not the person who is receiving the email's role to response/deal with, should ensure that they respond to the emailer advising them who they have passed the query/issue on to and/or provide the CEx email address for future contact."
Employee to be played call and coached with feedback.  Would suggest a period of quality monitoring.
Encouraging customers to visit prior to a mutual exchange. Whilst this isn't  ground for withholding consent a customer viewing would have ostensibly have avoid the issues raised following the MX assignment.
Engineer made a small mistake and didn't put the job to follow on- he closed it as complete so the office staff didnt know a new job needed to be raised. Conversation to be held with engineer. 
Engineer Notes following jobs
"Engineer reports must be structured and contain far more information about the repair issue, suspected thoughts on the issue and the status of the repair (such as containable, stopped leak etc). In this case we assumed from the report that this was minor when it wasn't. Ashley C needs to address this with all engineers to ensure this happens.
The engineer had the knowledge to have isolated the mains to stop the leak. Due to this not happening and Scheduling not arranging the appt correctly, the boiler part was badly corroded. Ollie should have called for advice if he did not know how to isolate the leak - Ashley to pick up with him.
We need to arrange for a contract to be agreed with our contractor as currently there is nothing to confirm timescales for parts etc. Dan S is working on this with finance currently - Dan S is currently discussing how to do this.
Scott picked up the email from Ollie on the 29th of April and arranged a repair for 3 weeks’ time when this clearly stated needed an engineer on the 2nd of May – can this be raised with Scott please?
We need to make sure that all comms with the tenant is logged on Orchard and CRM - Natalie can we make sure that when Schedulers call tenants to discuss appts or send letters that this is documented on Orchard. "
Engineer to return to refit silicone and adjust flooring
Engineer toolbox talk on good communication with customers and feeding back information good or bad contract managers 
Engineer who attended to measure windows to be spoke to and asked to explain why they never mentioned whole unit needs replacing.
Engineer who initially went to find a leak from above should have folowed the work on so the tenant wasnt left with a big hole in the ceiling. Engineer responsible no longer works for GCH
Engineers advised to take more care with tenants pets that are skittish. Advised on how to contain animals and around communicating this with the tenants.
Engineers need to be careful not to give wrong advice to tenants. A meeting needs to happen to ensure we are not advising incorrectly.
"Engineers need to be clearer on their notes when inspecting jobs and ensuring they are not closing jobs down when there are further works, this job was shut down and therfore the trail of the progress of this job stopped cold and therfore the customer was sat with out any update for several months. engineers require a toolbox talk to remind them of the importance of ensuring all notes, images are clear when inspecting and carrying out jobs and then adding to their handheld devices. also they need to be more vigilant to ensure they are not shutting jobs doen when there are further works. Scheduling team need to run  a daily / weekly report whatever suits to cross ref notes against any shut down jobs to ensure none have ben mistakenly shut down when they should have been passed to further works ."
Engineers need to make sure that they are updating notes after every job so correct follow ons can be raised. 
"Engineers should feedback any uncertainty over jobs to their supervisors.  This, in turn should be fed back to the customer."
Ensure customers are kept routinely informed during the process and in particular if a telephone appointment had been scheduled. It further highlights the need for ICT investment in basic work flow for contact management to ensure customers are called back as required
Ensure follow up works are followed up by person carrying out inspection the ensure they are completed. Works should be followed from start to end and resident updated.
Ensure that customers are fully updated before Engineer leaves the property.
"Ensure that ILO addresses any issues as quickly as possible, rather than let them go on for too long unresolved. ILO to explain proper service procedures to resident queries to ensure no confusion on why the service makes the decisions that it does."
Ensure that officers focus on the details of the ASB investigation and not to refer to previous complaints that have been submitted. Tone of Voice to be discussed and reiterated at the next team meeting. 
ESW team informed verbally to not carry on using empty bins to take excess waste from other bins in the block as this penalises those trying to manage their waste responsibly.
ESW to dispose of waste and then report back any fly tipping that will result in service charges to the block
"Every effort was made to accommodate the amount of repairs that had been added after the initial inspection. Although tenants friend states he needs someone with him for appointments, both Steve L & David B confirm tenant was not stressed or overwhelmed when they visited 22/11/21. Further to this our Neighbourhood team have visited and spoken directly with the tenant and he has expressed going forward he wants his brother involved rather than his friend  when it comes to repairs or complaints."
"Explained to Ms. hayes the current DFG process and was Gloucester City Council led process and apologised this was not communicated to her at the time. Agreed OT contact had been patchy due to huge influx of cases of late and apologised. Outlined that the process would take a few months and we would also need to apply for statutory consents, planning etc. Customer happy and felt more informed."
Explanation given in relation to the work that was carried out was in line with the Police request made when the carpenter was onsite OOH (minimal materials available). A door was requested that could be locked so scenes of crime officers could access the site later. Police asked that the door was fitted quickly for privacy reasons.
Extended due to initial correspondents being sent to wrong email address and then following this a member of staff involved in works which needed to be clarified  on sick leave for two weeks. Compensation offered and  explination given as to faultsand issues encountered during recent months with regard to getting fixed and resolutions to aunt'sproperty.
Extension agreed with customer due to inspection taking place in late December.  A further extension was required as  Miss Furmage forgot about her inspection. New appoinment in in place on 06/01/2020.  Surveyor reported Mould growth is down to condensation.  Anti-bac treatment being arranged & a 3 month post inspection will be in place.  Customer has been supplied a list of best practice and a condensation leaflet.  Complaint not upheld as educaiton of customer is the key requirement.
Extent of works required mis-diagnosed by plumber and supervisor - there was a secondary issue. Apology issued with offer of £500 compensation. Works to be completed as quickly as possible with post inspection by supervisor and follow up call to ensure tenant is happy with works. Compensation offer subsequently increased to £1000.
Extention agreed with customer due to 8 The Butts being out of the country until January.  Repairs cant take place until she is back.  All actions taken from a Repairs perspective have taken place efficiently & to a timely manner.  Lee Dorrington is managing the customers renovation to his bathroom & kitchen ceiling repairs as a project also offering to be his direct point of contact for any future repairs moving forwards.   The customer has had slightly over his required compensation for the dehumidifier which is being credited to his rent account at his request.  We are also arranging for his carpet to be cleaned at the end of the repair and as a goodwill gesture fitting him a full size sink in his bathroom.  All repairs have been agreed verbally with Mr Lewin who found the work suggested as suitable.
Failed appointment - £20 credit on heating account offered. Remainder of complaint unjustified as ample opportunity for earlier meter installation. LP to compare actual usage from account readings with weekly rent charge and to offer further credit id case proven
Failure was historic and appears to be a individual error by an employee no longer at GCH
Fault diagnosis needs to be better on first visit - Appropriate competant staff to be sent to allocated jobs. Repairs system does not highlight repeat visits and no reports avaialable to run that would highlight these.  Full team of engineers shoul dmake thi seasier and new repairs system due in 2023/24 finacial year will provide additional support and reporting tools to minimise these types of issues.

"Fence has now been arranged to be repaired.
We are going to replace the window handle so it matches.
£50 goodwill payment for miscommunication and frustration."
Fencing is being replaced and repair jobs have all been scheduled.
"Flood was caused by a nearby foul drain overflowing into the property - extensive damage/contamination and residue left behind. Apology given and noting the inconvenience/ damaged bedroom and lounge furniture (seen by supervisor and photos provided), £1500 compensation has been offered/accepted."
Flow plates in car park are before the barrier and therefore it would have been impossible for the customer to not have damage to vehicle once the barrier failed.  Estimated cost for repair has been covered as compensation award (£350). Apology issued.
"Follow up information all now collated and second response letter sent. No compensation justified, provided Mr Hancock with updated provisional dates for component renewals and confirmed that he must request retrospective permission for alterations made. See letter on file"
"Following a conversation with Mr Davis, it was clear that he felt undervalued and that his call in to our office was not taken seriously enough, which in turn left him very upset and frustrated. This was further compounded due to the fact we could not facilitate another appointment durring the allocated time slot. Mr Davis did then ask to speak to a manager on the day of the missed appointment, to which he was told, they would get one to contact him back, however this was passed to a customer experience team leader and they did not call  Mr Davis back until the following day, this then added further frustration that led to the complaint. Upon receiving the complaint I called Mr Davis and then visited him to reassure him that i would look in to why he was not allocated another apointment on the same day and also look to getting another appointment arranged, Mr Davis was happy that we were now taking him seriously and was clear that he just wanted the repair sorted asap as he was concerned that he may slip over if we had a frost as a result of the issue that needed resolving. I also advised that I would look into what the expectation was for the Manager calling him back on the same day."
following a review of the income process and strengthening of procedures by  following more robust case management this should not occur again.
Following an investigation into the poor workamnship and communication from MBM to Ms Middleton I have to agree that poor service was provided to the customer. Ms Middleton made it clear from my meeting with her that she did not want MBM back to her home as she had lost total faith in them and was not confident in their ability to resolve the issues she had reported and because they just never got back to her. Ms Middleton wanted the poor workamnship putting right and this involved remedial works to the initial privatly paid for drive way works that she had installed (damaged by mbm when carrying out concreting works). Ms Middleton provided me with  a quote from NCS drop kerb ltd to remedy the issues left by MBM and MBM have agreed to pay for this as a way of compensation for the issues caused by their initial poor workmanship. Ms Middleton  has been offered the £300.00 + Vat compensation and she has agreed to accept. This offer will be sent in writing with the resolution letter.
"Following an investigation involving the Housing Officer, Team Leader and the Home Group advocate, no evidence was found to show GCH gave false information or negatively influenced the tenant to end the joint tenancy. GCH remained consistent in its decision making (supported by GCH Policies) re. not granting sole tenancy after refusing an Assignment of Tenancy to the joint tenant because of how the joint tenancy was conducted. (This includes £4k rent arrears.) Consequently the complaint is not upheld. The property concerned has now been vacated with keys awaited.
It should be noted that the HO (KB) coordinated and organised the relevant information and staff involved in the complaint to a very high standard enabling a comprehensive investigation."
"Following appts have been arranged:

· 16th February – Dehumidifier was delivered to the property to help resolve the damp issue.
· 20th February – Mould wash in your child’s bedroom is being completed between 8am and 10:45am. 
· 28th February – Scaffolding will be put up.
· 2nd March – Gary Roofing will be attending to complete the following:
	· Replace the slipped tile on the corner elevation and make good
	· Gutter Clean
	· Insulate the roof space
· Also, on this date GCH will be attending to remove concrete plant pot on side elevation and re new rendering.

I could not get hold of tenant to discuss but confirmed in email and letter that I have requested a list of items they have lost due to damp and mould and then I will offer compensation to round up to £1000.00 comp in total."
"Following Independent damp surveyors reccommendations, appointed NKS to 
-	Removal of substandard kitchen extraction fan and make good decorations. 
-	Install new extraction fan as per Dave’s recommendation above the cooker space. 
-	Removal of the bathroom floor, to investigate potential fault with the waste facility. 
-	Rectify leak to the toilet waste. 
-	Replace the extractor fan in the bathroom and ducting to be checked (and replaced, if necessary) as per recommendations. 
-	Make good bathroom following works including, new flooring. 
-	Supply 1 x Dehumidifier for bedroom 2 and allow for visits to empty the machine. 
-	Return circa 3 weeks later to scrape back, sand and decorate in white – 1 x bedroom wall.                                Resident has also sent photos damaged items as a result of the damp/mould issue. Photos and costs supplied. This came to circa £1350, following a conversation with EC that although this is over the £1000 threshold, it was a fair amount to offer as compensation and would be better value for money than capping at £1000 and having a potential stage 2/legal dispute on our hands. Full breakdown and photos on file. "
"Following investigation, I could see that when bathroom was due to be done the plans stated the stud wall to be removed and turned into 1 bathroom. This was not done, upon post inspection the tenant advised us that it hadnt been done, however no notes to prove this on surveyors post inspection. Based on the intitial report and tenants circumstances with their special needs son, I have agreed for us to take on these works and job raised. In regard to the bedroom stud wall, i have advised tenant they will need to carry out these works themselves and provide us with the name of company/person carrying out works along with copy of insurances and proffessional registration. They will also let us know when works complete so we can inspect. "
"Following my investigation on th eissues highlighted I can confirm the following actions have been and are in progress to resolve these issues:  I have been informed provisionally that the leak has been causing the damage from No 16 has been fixed, However I am still awaiting confirmation of this. The leaks causing damage in th ecommunal areas and your mothers lounge have been tracked back back to waste pipes from flats 14 & 15 and we are currentlly waiting on the contractor  to provide a date  to carry out these works and then access to the properties can be arranged. Once th eleaks have been fixed a period of drying out will be required. (Suggested two weeks initially) Dehuumidifiers to be supplied if required. Once drying out has completed any affected areas to be repaired and brought to a finish suitable fo rdecoration and a white mist coat applied. All communal areas will also be treated in th esame way and brought back to a decorated finish. "
Following my phone call with the tenant she would like to withdraw her complaint.
"Following my visit to your property on Friday 28th October 2022 I can confirm the following: 

GCH Will:

-	Replace the sink base unit of your kitchen. 
-	Replace the broken/missing base unit door of your kitchen. 
-	Replace the section of water damaged worktop. This is the section on top of the sink base unit. 
-	Arrange for our repairs team to attend your property to complete the required repairs within your bathroom. This will include resolution of any leaks under the bath. Refixing the bath panel and making good the water damaged wall. A member of our scheduling team will contact you to arrange this. 

Please note that although we will try to match the kitchen unit and worktop as closely as possible, we cannot guarantee this. 

GCH Will not: 

-	Replace your kitchen in full. The other areas of your kitchen have not been water damaged; they have been damaged through their use. This includes, the kickboards being removed, units being painted black, writing/drawing on them, a missing door and cuts/gauges in the worktop. Damaged caused the tenant(s) is not a reason for GCH to replace the kitchen. Your current kitchen is due to be renewed in full in 2035, as the kitchen was replaced in 2015 before you moved in (a 20-year lifespan). However, I will change its renewal date to 2030. 
-	Replace your bathroom. This will remain on the renewal programme for 2035. 
"
following site meetings and visits any potential delays are passed to the solicitors. it is then the buyers solicitors responsibility to pass relevant information on to the buyer.
Following the initial email communication I managed to speak with the customer on Thurs 06/06/19 and arranged a home visit to inspect the tree/bush on the boundary of 28 Archdeacon Court. Given the customers works full time I offered before and after work appointments and we met at 7.45am on Tues 11/06/19. I captured photos on site and reassured Mr Symonds that matter would be dealt with. I met with Lee Dorrington (Repairs Manager) on Tues 11/06/19 to ask that the Estate Services Team progress the matter given the delays. The works were completed within 24 hours and the customer email me to thank me for my support and resolving the issue. Full complaint letter sent on 12/06/19. Complaint upheld given the delays by Estate Services and the communication lapses (compounded by Mr Symonds emails going into GCH's junk mail in Outlook)
For future vacancies on this rural scheme we will ask Stroud District Council to verify the local connection prior to the short listing stage on Homeseeker Plus. In this way they can liaise with Horsley Parish as necessary. This will reduce the burden on our Tenancy Services resources and hopefully improve the customer experience
For leasehold management complaints there needs to be a joined apporach between the Leasehold and ASB teams and the customer provided with clear information of what we can and what we're unable to achieve by way of an investigation. 
Formal apology given. System brought forward his gas service time due to no accesses. An auto-generated letter woud have been sent. The customer has called in the same day of the no access and we have rebooked for the same day but the letter was still sent.
Formal complaint response sent on 19/06/19. On reviewing the case with Dan Lutman and the Tenancy Sustainment Team it’s clear that all the pre-tenancy contact and checks were completed in line with established practice. The issues regarding rent liability has arisen as the customer moved in during the second week of the tenancy and therefore Housing Benefit as an occupancy benefit was not paid for the first week. Under the circumstances and given the vulnerability of the customer due to mental health factors I recommended a discretionary x1 week credit to be applied to the rent account. This also reflects the delay in the viewing during the 2 week countdown to handover which may of had an impact on the overall customer experience.
Formal meeting has taken place with MBM to address this issue. They have advised a change in management has occurred and they are working on improving their service. We are now keeping more work in house to limit the amount of work that we outsource. I have offered £50 as a gesture of goodwill.
"frontline staff to be aware of our rights and responsibilites regarding pests. Quicker turn around on first notification of the issue. job raised in january and large amount of notes going back and fourth on what to do next. maybe a solid process where it gets assigned to a supervisor to oversee and make contact/final decision. Then another job in march to do cctv survey, which contractor advised could be getting into loft space, looks as though notes from contractor just got put into orchard and nothing further raised to investigate. Until tenant calls up 8 months later to chase again.  Our service standard to be confirmed with contractors, as 5 weeks on from job being raised, contractors hadnt contacted the tenant so had to outsource - or a process where we chase? Update, pest control are fitting 2 one way valves to the man holes. Have visited number 7 and the issue has stopped there. He is also visiting number 6 on 31/01 to investigate their property. "
Full and detailed response addressing all points made. No request for specific resolution.
"Full complaint investigation took place with a welfare visit to see the customer by Service Master. An incident report was received, alongside assurances from the contractor in terms of safe systems of working. A meeting took place at RWH offices on Weds 15/01/2020 during which time the complaint was reviewed in terms of the incident timeline. On this occasion we concluded that it was likely that the customer had fallen due to water from foot fall (or a buggy) in the communal area given it was raining on 07/01/202 when the incident took place. The reported incident was circa 3 hours after the clean had been completed in the block, with industry standards suggesting a 5 minute drying time. Conveyed our apologies and sympathy to the customer for what seems to have been an accident with no causal issues from the communal cleaning works. Our new housing officer for the area Kate Bird will call in to see the customer when in the locality to introduce herself and see how she's getting on"
Full explanation of the end of tenancy termination/deceased process to be provided when next of kin start the process so they are fully aware of the policy and charges to be applied and how we will do this.
Full investigation conducted and site visit carried out to arrange all outstanding works within an agreed timescale. Timeline included in response letter. Previously offered compensation of £70 (not paid) increased to £100.
Full investigation conducted including obtaining legal guidance from Capsticks (which included advice that lease terms override any subsequent wishes to amend them). Telephone conversation was held with the tenant to clarify exactly which elements of his letter he required specific responses to. The conversation indicated this will be escalated then go to the Ombudsman regardless of the response sent. (Telephone recording saved). Response letter addressed every point tenant sought an answer to.
Full redecoration of bathroom and kitchen. Also a housing officer to speak with tenant in the flat above (no. 10) about the impact of allowing water onto the floors whilst washing. 
full tenancy audit should have highlighted the issues with the bathroom. CS officers should return calls when they say thety will. Awareness raised for theCS team.
Full verbal response to complainant 21/04/2023. No record of vulnerabilities on GCH files. Fullhistory and current nsituation explained and offer of support and advice made.
"Further investigation showed an asbestos survey was present upon commencement of tenancy and provided as part of the void pack which mitigates our responsibility.  I do agree that this caused confusion as it was saved in a historic place not visible through our normal process so at face value woud appear there was no survey.  I do also agree there were some communication issues and delays that whilst some may have been outside of our control, we are still culpable for.  We offered a schedule of works to the customer for necessary asbestos removal alongside a goodwill removal but the teannt has refused this on several occasions.  The only option they are willing to accept is a management move which we are not prepared to offer given there is limited liability and a full and suitable solution avaliable.  I have left it open for the customer to contact me to arrange and will oook at all possible solutions for works to be completed with minimal disruption."
Further training or feedback regarding comments made during the conversation. Customer did not have an issue with what was advised but how it was said.
"Further Update on case provided, apologised for slow service. "
"Garage door to be delivered and installed at the end of Sept 21. JP to make contact with resident to start the process of the roof replacement for 8 Melick and next door neighbour. Delays have been due to GCH not wanting to pay for neighbours roof due to construction type. £250 Compensation also agreed due to damaged items in the garage from the leaking roof - bbq, bike, rug. "
"Gas co-ordinator called tenant 2/12 and discussed the situation fully, apologised for any stress/anxiety caused and raised a job for a plug repair needed. Customer confirmed she was happy with everything and the complaint has been rescinded."
Gas service was completed but no failings so nothing to be agreed.
Gate required fabrictaing again as path was widended.  Lack of communication during this process which took excessive time.  Apologised to the customer.  Gate was installed 05/07/2019
GCH accepted liability due to repairs not being carried out correctly and in a satifactory time scale. (These have now been completed.) Compensation of £450 has been offered due to the impact on the resident (rib injury and hospital visit). 
GCH acted rapidly through this process and there is nothing to learn from here. 
GCH carried OOH appt perfectly and there were no failings from GCH.
GCH done everything they can to sort this issue. There have been several visits to the property over the past 12 months and several inspections to look at the damp and mould issues. Arrangements have been made to ensure the damp and mould issues are treated as quickly as possible. 
GCH Electrical Manager serviced the door entry system one month prior and was in full working order.  System was since vandalised.  A new armiture is on order however previous repairs were managed within normal timescales.
"GCH have agreed the following : replace kitchen doors and plinths and a sink base unit, replace 3 x doors to upstairs, repalce lounge door, agreed to replace leaking water stop tap, 1 x decs voucher to kitchen, 1 x decs voucher to bathroom, 1 x kaytel fire insert for lounge, re-install fan correctly in bathroom, repair faulty window in small bedroom, install smoke alarm in lounge."
"GCH haven't failed in service, garage acct ended in 2017 due to non payment of rent - MR A complained about access to the garage this was not rasied during the current tenancy period only after terminated and monies were chased. He refused to pay this amount unless we gave him the garage back"
GCH is resposible for gutter leaks so when a leak is reported we need to investigate. The garden issue is and has been worked on but the neighbours werent cooperating with the NM at the time with multiple no access appointments
"GCH need to be more proactive in undertaking inspections during after works, it is not acceptable for customers to have to call in months later as they were expecting someone to visit earlier to inspect. IL to convey to Asset Management team the importance of this."
GCH need to take more time to explain damp and mould issues so that the customer fully understanding how it relates to their  and what can be done on both sides to reduce it 
"GCH no longer use MD for doors, the lead times are greater than Novus or Anglian.  Customers need to be given a realistic timescale for new doors, currently running at 12-14 weeks with Novus."
GCH operative attending 22/04/21 to complete mould wash and treatment to worst affected areas prior to an independant Damp survey to identify the main cause and advise on recommendations. OT referral booked 27/04/21 to assess housing needs to address disabilities.
GCh Repairs operative has received training to ensure that they follow the correct process for this type of job moving forward
"GCH Repairs team operative to receive training to ensure this does not happen again. Have offered £100.00 in compensation to recompence for time lost shopping and going outdoors in the nice weather with her child. Also, the inconvenience of a 1815 visit by engineers when she was bathing her child just before she goes to sleep, disrupting her routine. "
GCH to chase 3rd party contractors more regularly to gain updates and progress reports and to provide tenants with updates if 3rd party contractors are not. 
"GCH to cover the cost incurred as our officer advised the neighbours to get the police involved (when they rang, concerned they could not raise an answer from the tenant depite her car being on the drive). I have phoned and spoken to the tenant and she is happy with this outcome. "
GCH to ensure they contact MBM on a daily basis as not to lead to any further unnecessary delays. With Natalie starting in new position and live in role from August. SL & NK to discus robust process to be put in place and monitored. 
GCH to get Lovell to re-attend to re-assess the roof as the leak is still present at the property even though Lovell's have repaired the roof. 
GCH to improve upon providing tenants updates/feedback and progress reports across both CX and Scheduling teams. GCh to also chase 3rd party contractors for updates and appointment dates agreed directly with tenants
GCH to undertake further works to make Westgate car park safe.
GCH’s communication has been very poor in relation to the outstanding repairs. I can assure you that I have raised feedback with our Scheduling Team to ensure that we are following through on inspections to ensure tenants are kept up to date with outstanding actions
Given tenant's preference for email communication I emailed him on 4th March 2021 to see if he would like to speak with me or provide any further information in relation to his complaint. As there was no response I met with Paul Reilly (ASB Team Leader) and Jo Weavin (ASB Officer) to go through the customers feedback and to see who can provide further support to the customer. The case history shows routine contact and requests for the customer to provide evidence to assist our ASB investigation. Customer indicated that he has issued a formal complaint against the Police which sits outside of any tenancy related issues. I set out actions for ongoing support and advised him to activate the Community Trigger if he remains dissatisfied.
Given the Covid 19 restrictions we were unfortunately unable to visit Mr Mayo at home as part of the complaint investigation and I apologised to Mr Mayo in this regard. During a phone conversation Mr Mayo highlighted the particular issue of concern was a fence panel banging from his neighbour at number 6 who he blamed for the disruption. We agreed that we would look at the fencing as a priority and Property Care attending within 24 hours to complete a temporary repair and for further remedial works to be completed in due course. Having investigated the matter Mr Mayo has periodically made reports in the past regarding his elderly neighbour and her small dog. (Its noted that the neighbour has health issues and is currently seeking a move to be nearer her family for support purposes).  Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) has contacted the elderly neighbour at number 6 The Retreat who is vulnerable and raised the issues of the banging fence for which she was happy for GCH staff to enter her rear garden and complete any repairs necessary to improve the situation for her neighbour. In my response to Mr Mayo I have offered advice and support regarding restorative practices given the nature of his complaint and also recourse to the Community Trigger if he remains dissatisfied with our approach. During our telephone conversation I also asked Mr Mayo if given the stay at home advice guidance in respect of Government advice for Coronavirus if we could provide any additional support and he confirmed that he was okay an managing to go out weekly for shopping purposes. 
"Given the reports of rats within the property it was agreed that Property Care would arrange for a specialist contractor to undertake a series of treatment to resolve the issues. Ordinarily these type of pest control works would be progressed by the customer but discretion was exercised to ensure the matter was resolved for the customer.

"Gutter to be cleared by PC, mould treatement (PC),render (Lovell) and Windows (Anglian). Issues had never been reported by tenant and tenant does not remember making a disrepair claim."
Had arranged for a CS&EM to contact Ms M as to next steps in terms of her ASB complaint.  Complaint upheld as the case had been closed without clear communication as to why and the issues were still continuing.  In addition a new case had been opened for the cannabis but nothing further had happened.
Happy to drop the complaint for now after i have visited her and explained that we will need to go through a process of asking the other residents of Oliver close that they agree to the reduction/removal of the trees. Have given the lady my Number so she can contact me directly regarding this throughout the process.
Have advised Mr Hoskins that bed bugs are tenants responsibilty and that this issue need to be dealt with before we arrange any repairs. have asked though for photos of mould to be sent so we can assess and review this decision.

"Have agreed to fix the window today to make safe. Have raised CRJM for planned as the property is due for window repplacement this financial year, and think it would be a good idea to change them before winter sets in. "

Called 1/4/22 but phone is still unavailabe. Email sent 4/4/22 as well as phone call but it is still saying phone is unavailable. Customer replied to email 4/4/22 with updated number have tried to call but went straight to voicemail (have left a message) Have also tried partners mobile which she provided in email (phone does not connect) If I have heard nothing back by 4pm 5/4/22 I will close the complaint down. 
Have been unable to contact the customer since an initial conversation 17/5/22. During the conversation I agreed to pay for cost of the locksmith he had to call out. The customer was waiting for the final bill so we could process the payment. Have oulined in response letter this agreement. 
"Have not been able to contact tenant.  Listened to call recording that he was complaining about and issues raised in his complaint were not dicussed in the call, therefore complaint not upheld"
Have offered compensation of £100 for experiencing unnecessary delays as a result of MBM not contacting the tenant to organise the repair.

"Have the final garden fence post reinstated by 29/04/2022. Install the final fence panel back after this.
Any rendering mess to be cleaned from your decking/garden.
The void underneath your decking to be filled with soil. This can be done within the next week. 
I have been informed by our Contractor that the scaffolding has now been removed from your path. All materials will be cleared from here and the path will be cleaned by the end of this week. This area will then be heras fenced off and we will be installing close board fencing to finish this area within the next two weeks. Please just be aware that this path sits directly next to our site so I would recommend avoiding using this path until the close board fencing is installed.  
Thank you for also sending through receipts for compost and decking items, totalling £54.08. As a gesture of good will, I can confirm that GCH will reimburse you for these items and offer to pay you a further £445.92 as compensation for the works your husband carried out to the decking and for the use of your pathway to erect the scaffolding. This will bring the total compensation payment to £500."
Have written to customer (as per his request) apologising that notice was not given for the works. (These were to a void property and our previous undertaking to give notice related to planned works - however we did not clarify repairs/voids were excluded.) Also apologised for the works being carried out before 8am and informed him  we have spoken to our contractors to ask them not to begin any works before 8am. This message will also be passed onto the repairs operatives. 
Have written to Mr Liddell explaining we visit the garage site every 4 weeks and regularly are in the area so will check when we are there on the other occasions as well. When i visited the garage site all garages were boarded up and I could not see any signs of drug use. Have asked Mr Liddell to carry on bringing to our attention any incidents and if necessary call 101 if he has concerns of  drug taking.
"Having listened to the 3 relevant call recordings it was agreed that there had been confusion during the 2nd call regarding the escalation to a stage one complaint and the process behind this. Shereen advised that the call would need to be put through to a manager as the complaint was about her. I have advised the customer that this will be discussed with the team moving forward in terms of complaint handling. I have advised that the information given during the 3rd call, regarding referral to ASB, was correct. At no point did Shereen refuse to assist - she made several attempts to clarify the concerns being raisedregarding the block and advised what she intended to refer/to which team. "
"Having spoken to Mr Greathead a couple of times, it is not possible to separate the complaint about his allegations about Steve's attitude with the repairs service.  I made it clear that I was just looking into attitude and he kept saying that he had been lied to, which is a service failure rather than an staff attitude issue.  At no time did he say that Steve had been rude to him.  After speaking with him a second time, it became clear to me that it should all be dealt with under 1 complaint as it was impossible to separate the two and was becoming confusing for both of us.  I have written to him to state that I am merging the 2 complaints into 1 so that all aspects can be addressed as a Stage 2 complaint.  He does not want Steve Langston visiting his moms property again."
"Having spoken with customer I confirmed that we would audit the ASB case on the basis of her complaint and feedback. Whilst the routine case management was satisfactory including the issuing of a NOSP, during a period where notices were extended due to Covid, there were elements around the opening of the case and closure which could have been better on this occasion. It's also regrettable that during the NOSP period the customer decided to terminate her tenancy and move into the private rental sector. Confirmed the complaint was upheld and apologised by phone and in writing."
Head of Housing is reviewing the position to understand issues with the data transfer. Once this has been completed annual service checks will be used to ensure data held remains accurate.
"Hello, My name is Karen Mitchell, I would just like to complain about the way my repair has been handled. I even had to write to the MP for help. It started back in July when my garage door broke. I reported it broken the end of July. Someone from the council came they measured the garage door as they said I had to have a new one. They secured it and said it could take up to 5 weeks to get it delivered. I am disabled and knew this was going to be a problem for me because I use the garage to put my disabled scooter in, this meant that I would struggle to go out. That was fine I accepted it was going to take 5 weeks. On the 28th September, the council came out and gave me three excuses of why it was not done, first excuse, was it was not on their system for that day, the second excuse was there was only one person, and the third excuse was there was no one around to let them in. There was my neighbour here who had the key to let them in and there was a note out. So I was clearly fobbed off for whatever reason. It was then rebooked in for 31st October another month. So all in all that was a 12 week wait so far. Then 31st October comes I get a telephone call from you saying it has to be cancelled because they had too many jobs on. Well they must of knew that they were coming to do my garage door as it was booked in advance being disabled I should of been a priority.  To make matters worse the wind blew the garage door into the middle of the road nearly hitting a car and passers by. I telephoned you straight away.  That wasn't a priority either, I had to then call my son to come and secure it. Absolutely fuming, I decided to contact the MP who then contacted yourselves. I have now got an appointment tomorrow pending nobody calls to cancel.  I am absolutely appalled and disgusted with the way the whole situation has been handled and I feel I have been let down. Disabled people put there trust in their landlord, it is not as easy for us to do the little tasks and I feel like my trust has been lost. If my garage door is not replaced tomorrow or it gets cancelled for whatever reason, I will be taking the matter further."
"Highlighted previous stage 2 had already investigated and accepted GCH errors.  Investigation was based on issues received after.  Accepted and apologised for length of repair however there were major structural works and a national lockdown which extended this.  Agreed that there were still some snagging issues but highlighted the customer had not allowed us access and had informed us she did not wish to continue.  Evidence was also provided of the customer accepting the bedroom tax on her current property even when she was in smaller decanted one, which was against our advice.  Have broken down the offer of compensation, said we will complete any snagging issues and as a goodwill gesture to give her piece of mind, we woud get another structural survey completed."
"Highlighted the delay in being able to effectively investigate and respond to this complaint case as it took approx. a week for the phone calls to be recovered to review. I wrote to the customer by email on 23/07/19 and apologised for the delay due to the ICT phone call recovery issues. Responded on 25/07/19 as stated in my email. Reviewed the phone call and reflected that there was a clear attempt to help the customer, notwithstanding it was a difficult conversation. Met and discussed the call with Shereen Martin and advised the customer complaint and the findings of my review. Shereen and I also initiated contact with the GCC Enabling Team to consider new build large properties as the underlying issue for the customer. I also referred the case to Property Services for an OT assessment and consideration of further adaptations, extension or viability of a Pod. I spoke with Miss Millin on Fri 26/07/19 regarding my response and the agreed actions going forward to assist the household in identifying alternative housing options. I also apologised to Miss Millin in the correspondence any by phone given her perception of the initial customer contact"
"Hole where rat(s) gained access was not made clear to GCH when it we filled the hole. Rats had been present in house for a long period of time (nested in the sofa). Although no clear mention of pest responsibilities in the tenanncy agreement, this information can be found online and tenant could have been informed if he had called either his Neighbourhood manager or switchboard. For the asbestos to have caused any issues it would have been needed to be smashed up - sweeping would not cause dangerous fibres to be released. The asbestos has since been removed."
Home visit undertaken to the property at 121 Sandyleaze on 19/05/19 engaging with the customer and a friend in addressing issues regarding the state of the garden. A skip was evident and the clearance works under progress. A further home visit was undertaken by Deborah Preece (Housing Officer) on 20/06/19 where inspection photos were undertaken highlighting the significant improvement. I updated the customer throughout by email and received feedback thanking me for my intervention and noting the improved condition of the garden area. Full complaint response sent in writing 22/05/19
Hopefully by getting on top of the processes and addressing all historical arrears we should not run into this issue again as we are not missing accounts and we are completing prompt chase.
Human error that Supervisor Inspection was missed. Job was attended the next day as soon as the error was flagged up. Unable to locate the relevant call recording from the customer who claimed that there was a lack of empathy on the call but have agreed to monitor individuals calls over a period. Have offered a £50 goodwill gesture due to booking time off work.
"I am very disappointed with the  length of my repair. Back a few months I had a new shower unit fitted, then a couple of weeks ago I noticed some mould on my bedroom wall and my carpet wet and water ingress into my wardrobe, the workman came out to investigate (Stuart investigated and found the water leak to be the compression joint where shower unit had been fitted, the actual leak was at the other end of the compression joint, so therefor the 4 tiles in the wet room had to be removed to gain access to repair which he did, Paul the supervisor to Stuart that he would have to let it dry out and inspect. in the meantime my living conditions are strained to a limit has when I rang this morning the person who answer my query I believe was Natasha who was helpful as she could be and suggested that someone would come and inspect, On Tuesday of next week the 20th, I thought this was not very good, I am going to get some legal advice, as I believe the fault stemmed from the fitting of the shower unit and unable to see the leak at the time of fitting because it was from behind the wet room tiles, I have notice that my water bill has gone up quite considerable, that my carpet and wardrobe have been damaged by water, yes I have been able to have a shower by putting a plastic bag over the hole, and have to do this because of my medical condition to be ultra hygienic, I  will make a compensation claim."
I am visiting the tenant on thursday. But i spoke with them on the phone and advised we were in target with the repair (allbeit an inconvienience to the tenant) I apologised for the misscimmunication as the tenant was told by first operative that it would be a follow up emergency appointment by a contractor to jet the blockage. Said i would feed the info back to their supervisor. Agreed to change the kitchen taps as there is a history of them frequently leaking but never been replaced just fixed. I will replace the back board to a cabinet as this was removed following an unrelated historical repair. couldnt remember what for as tenants husband dealt in past but he has passed away. I will also be visiting to try to remove stain to the drainer caused by a chemical used by an operative when attending for repair. Tenant felt she was being called a liar when she called to mention as person who took the call said the plumber said it wasnt him so must have been tenant. 
"I am writing a formal complaint in regards to the recent repairs that have been carried out and outstanding at 6 Shelley Avenue. I would like to start of by saying as a tenant at this property I have had no complaints from yourselves, as rent is always paid up to date and regularly overpaid. On the 18th September a repairer visited the property as requested from my husband who logged a repair approximately a week before, in regards to our boiler which wasn't functioning properly. The engineer who attended attempted to fix the boiler on a very rushed visit, which resulted in the problem being unresolved and actually made worse. My husband then had to recall to request this repair to which we then had to wait another two weeks until the 4th of October for an appointment, where my husband had to book a day off work and wait, to then be called last minute and told the engineer would not be attending. He then rebooked again, having to wait a further week where an appointment was made for the 11th October again having to book time off work, the same engineer arrived and stated further parts were required to complete the repair this time, and we would have to rebook yet another appointment for them to fit it. The next appointment was yet another week later on the 17th October, to which another day was booked off of work by my husband, only to be called at the last minute again to say the engineer could not attend. At this point my husband requested to speak to management in regards to the fact that consistent appointments had failed to be attended with a long wait in between. He was called back by the repairs manager who explained they had staffing problems with personal issues, which consisted of family health conditions and a tenant with cancer who was undergoing chemotherapy. Although my husband sympathised I find it highly unprofessional that this information was brought to his attention as although very sad doesn't excuse the lack of service and the wait in between appointments. On the 19th of October a separate repair as arranged by our housing officer regarding a wall sealed ,and again my husband had booked time off from work as this was extremely important, because it was involving cigarette smoke leaking into our eight year old daughters bedroom from next door imposing on her health. Again at the very last minute he was called and told they would not be able to make it.The next appointment regarding the broken boiler was on the 30th October, where two engineers arrived and dismantled the boiler condemning it as it was beyond repair, which  left us with no heating or hot water from that point and explained someone from the office would be in touch regarding a replacement boiler. Management to make a compliant and to receive an update on the repair. He spoke to the repairs manager, who apologised and explained that he would chase the contractor for the job, and took my husbands mobile number and said he would get back with a response. Since then the contractors have made contact and stated we would need two further appointments, one to carry out a survey which has since been done on the 31st of October, and two an asbestos survey by a separate company before works can even be carried out. When my husband asked for a timescale on when works would be carried out, so we could have our hot water and heating working, the representative from Glevum explained that it could take several days for them to get the results back from the asbestos survey, which is booked for Friday 2nd November.
As you can imagine this has been extremely stressful for all the family we have two children under the age of 10 who have not been able to have a bath, with no clear sign of when this will be rectified. We have also been without heating since the 18th September, and have had to use electric heaters which has become a considerable financial burden, especially when my husband has had to take wasted days off work. It is our right as tenants to have access to central heating that is economical, as well as hot running water as this is part of our tenancy agreement. As suggested by the engineer that visited on the 30th October we should be entitled to financial assistance with the cost of the electrical heaters which have been running since the 11th October, when we were given them. I am upset that this repair hasn't been treated as more urgent considering the time of year, and the fact that we have minors which is where my main concern is, as well as this ongoing time scale involving the asbestos survey which I believe is unnecessary, as if there was asbestos on site the landlords being yourselves should have an asbestos register.

"I am writing this complaint due to the amount out time it is taking to get back to me regarding my heaters not being powerful enough to heat my home.I have called countless times and been told I will be called back and I haven’t. It must be almost a month now if not longer that I had called to inform you of my heaters not being good enough to heat my home before these awful old mouldy windows suck all the heat out. I am freezing in my flat and I am really disappointed in how much I am being ignored regarding this issue. I have been told I need an appointment with slatters to come out and look at the heaters and organise to have bigger heaters put in - I have two tiny little heaters to heat my whole home and windows that look about 30 years old. Granted the windows are supposed to be getting replaced but in October were told this will be done and completed by March and clearly that’s not going to happen and god knows when they will actually be replaced. I also put in a repair due to the windows in the communal area all being broken (out of 6 windows only 1 shuts) which has also clearly been ignored. All I want is to be warm in my own home and I really don’t think that’s too much to ask for? 



"
"I am writing this letter for serious complaint of being messed around, Firstly I have ringed numerous of times to have my intercom fixed and nobody has fixed it and it’s been two years. Secondly, my shower is a health and safety hazard and I have young children under the age of 10 in my household, appointment have been may and it keeps getting cancelled or there not showing to the times and dates agreed. I have mental health, let alone I have children in the house, this is now seriously causing me really bad stress, this needs to be sorted, If this don’t I going to get some seek legal advice. As my shower room is dangerous to me and my children."
"I am writing to you to issue a formal complaint against Mark Phillips and his absolute disgusting and in my own opinion, unprofessional behaviour. I have not had any correspondence with Mr Phillips in regards to my rent account since setting up a payment plan with him that cleared my account despite calling into Gloucester city homes on numerous occasions asking to talk with him to let him know the current status of my housing benefit. I came home today on 22nd December to find this threatening letter for rent owed of £171.67 stating that he will give me ""7 days to clear the account"" and this is ""my last chance"" before he starts seeking possession of my home and may take court action. Mark Phillips is a bully who likes to call people on the weekends and evenings demanding money and this in my opinion is very unprofessional and could cause someone who is more vulnerable to harm themselves or even kill themselves, especially at a time when money is already tight with Christmas. As it is I pay my rent monthly and when I get paid on the 28th of December I will pay the outstanding  balance on my account, but to send a letter (that I have attached to this email) this threatening when I have had no correspondence with Mr Phillips is an absolute disgrace and that man's bully tactics are outrageous and does not show Gloucester city homes in a very good manner. I do expect this to taken as it is, a formal complaint and I do expect to hear the outcome of this."
"I apologised for the miscommunication. Miss Gale advised she didnt receive the letter with the first appointment date. The gate has been completed and to good standard, Miss Gale understood the engineer who was suppose to attend the following day had a mechanical issue with their vehicle . Miss Gale is not at a loss and is happy it got sorted"
I apologised to Mr Annis for the lack of communication and explained that his Neighbourhood Manager was off sick. I agreed with him that i would speak to all the Neighbourhood Managers regarding any potential Mutual Exchanges. He was happy with this.
"I apologised to Mr Crabb for the injury he has sustained. On inspection i  could not see an installation fault with the bin chute lid, the bar that threads through the hinges of the lid and the chute snapped cleanly as you could see the bar was still in position. I have emailed Hardall UK regarding a replacement bin chute lid and await their instruction, Hardall UK has advised that the lid bar had no reason to snap unless under great pressure as it is solid stainless steel "
"I apologised to Mr Hassan for the poor communication and the lenght of time the exchange was taking. I explained the factors involving an exchange with an external customer which could be out of our control, which he was happy with. I agreed to forwrad the case to the temp NM to prioritise and that the sign up would be in January (with an exact date to be agreed when contact is made in December)."
I arranged an inspection of her kitchen tiles to ensure these were safe. Engineer advised kitchen needed to be upgraded so now on the 23/24 programme. Mould wash for the kitchen offered once photos have been received. 
I arranged for an engineer to attend to complete another repair to the taps which was successful and tenant was very happy with this.
I believe we  have always acted in a timely manner when dealing with the previous leaks at the property. Property inspected 21st October to see if we could resolve any minor issues with the decorating. Raised all of the remedial works following the leak and as a measure of good will we have agreed to decorate the whole kitchen and bathroom. 
I contacted Jo Fear at the Nelson Trust on Fri 05/04/19 as soon as the email was received and provided Jo with the reassurance regarding our approach in terms of the PTI process. I referred the complaint by email to Barry Rees (Tenancy Services Team Leader) on Fri 05/04/19 and asked him to meet with Karen Williams on Mon 08/05/19 to discuss the matter. Karen provided a detailed response by email to Barry to support her reflections of the interview. I also met with Karen on Tues 09/04/19. I spoke with Jo again by phone on Thurs 11/04/19 for a reassurance update and that I didn't believe there was evidence to suggest there was a complaint to uphold. We discussed the matter may have been as a result  of a lack of connection between the colleagues involved and apologised if this had been the perception given (albeit unintentional on Karen's behalf). I confirmed the outcome in full in writing on 17/04/19
I contacted Mr Swain by phone and listened to his concerns in full in terms of how he considered our approach in responding to the initial email from his wife and the resulting phone call regarding his rent account and an historic court order. Having reviewed the phone call I met with Angela S via MS Teams to listen to her feedback and review the advice provided and whether we could have handled the matter differently. I also spoke with Natalie T to see whether we could reflect on the learning from this complaint and review  our approach to long standing court orders where arrears and court costs have been cleared. At the conclusion of the investigation I've upheld the complaint from Mr Swain. I find that his enquiry was perfectly reasonable and that the matter could have been addressed at the first point of customer contact with clarification provided in terms of the court order. I apologised on behalf of GCH.
"I contacted the customer by phone within 24 hours of receiving the complaint and customer was adamant that she wanted the matter raised for awareness and no more than a warning with the individual involved. She stated that she would withdraw the complaint if the consequences for the individual were more severe. She outlined her empathy for the operative given the lack of welfare facilities available which has been compounded due to Covid 19 restrictions. I confirmed that the matter had been raised with ServiceMaster who were undertaking an internal investigation with the operative concerned and that we would confirm the outcome in writing. A full investigation was completed by ServiceMaster involving their HR Team. The outcome including an apology was provided by email on 17/6/20. I discussed the outcome with ServiceMaster on 18/6/20 and also spoke with customer by phone who was happy with the outcome, with a formal HR led investigation and official warning to the operative concerned. I explained that ServiceMaster would also be writing an apology letter and I would confirm the complaint response in writing on 22/6/2020. The customer thanked me for dealing with the matter on her behalf."
I could find no evidence that Mr Dudfield had been accused of being abusive or a liar.  
I could not get contact with the tenant. Sent emails on 11th and 13th of April with no response and mulitple call attempts to the number but does not connect.
I did speak to Becky Hayward and she confirmed that Mark had also listened to the recording and felt that there were some things he could have changed and will think about this for the future 
I don't feel there are any lessons to be learnt here as we have tried to accommodate tenant requests as much as possible. He was happy to discuss and raise the repairs needed when the intial inspection took place 22/11/21. 
"I feel that  now have to raise this as a complaint. I reported a leak in my kitchen on the 1st September 2018. The bathroom fixtures above were sealed on a previous occasion. This did not alleviate the problem I therefore advised that this was an on going issue. A contractor came out and checked all around the bathroom, underneath etc. and found that there are no leaks in the bathroom. Through a process of elimination it was found that the probable cause was the outside roof joint and the lead flashing as this was in the same area as the leak. Furthermore the wall was extremely damp due to a heavy rainfall at the weekend. This was then booked in for the 22/10/18. I was then called and advised that this had to be a contractor who was unavailable so this would need to be re booked. It was booked for yesterday afternoon please note that time has had to taken off from work to accommodate these appointments. He came out yesterday and advised that this was not a roof leak but a broken pipe behind the walls. Therefore I still have a leak, he gave no response as to how to fix this or gave an alternative as to who could look at this. I am left with a leak in the wall, which is dangerously close to electrics and a gas cooker, no one appears to consider this a danger or a priority. I have a constant smell of damp and a wall that flakes so I am continuously wiping the sides down. I also have my 7 year old grandson who stays with me every other weekend he is prone to coughs and colds and I just hope that he gets nothing more serious than this, otherwise I will be taking this further. I would like an ""expert"" ""specialist"" who can come to the property and actually determine where the leak is so that this can be fixed. I keep my home to a good standard and expect that repairs would be completed at a reasonable time and if there is a problem that you as the landlord would ensure the same.

"
"I feel there are reterospective lessons learnt regarding closer liasion between H&N and Development ahead of new build schemes, to ensure that they can be managed effectively moving forward. Any potential issues in terms of neighbourhood management, ASB and crime could be highlighted."
"I got the keys to my property at the end of October 2018, in November I noticed a leak in my bedroom ceiling, I reported the matter straight away. I received a phone call 1 week later stating that a roofer will not be able to come to my property until the beginning of January. The roofer came out when stated and told me that there was nothing wrong with the roof (he only checked through the attic didn't actually go onto the roof) and told me it was just damp. He told me he would give this information to GCH and someone would contact me to deal with dampness in the ceiling. Tonight we have had a lot of rain and it has actually come through my roof, through my bedroom ceiling onto my bed and my carpet. I'm currently waiting for an engineer to contact me to come and assess it as a roofer is not available at this time to look. I am due a baby any day which will be sleeping in the room with the leak so need something done as a matter of emergency. This is not the only problem I've had since moving in as I had no hot water nor heating for 11 days with a 1 year old and 3 year old in the property."
"I had an appointment booked for today to look at fencing between 12-5.30, Ive waiting 2 weeks for appointment and took days unpaid leave from work to be able to keep appointment. At 430 I’d still not seen any work men I then recieved a text message to say the appointment had been rearranged for 11 April (another 3 weeks away) I then called your office to see what was going on to be told today’s appointment had been cancelled because there busy and higher priority than my repair, which i understand but I’m sure they could of called earlier to say so as not all Emergancy calls came in at one time.  Not only have I lost a days pay I’ve had to rely on someone to collect my children from school and now I have to wait another 3 weeks with the neighbours dog and other children in my garden and feeling unsafe as the garden is open to both neighbours. I think this is discusting service and your quick enough to moan when we miss your appointments"
I had emailed with no response but I called today and spoke to tayah.  she is all moved in now and incredibly happy.  There was a bit of miscommunication and the delay was caused by the outgoing tenant extending her notice as she was awaiting a new build which could have been shared with Tayah to encourage her that it was a valid delay and one she could have managed.  There was also miscommunication which was caused by CEX team not being able to access Lettings infomration through CRM - i have upheld the compaint and she is happy it has been closed 
"I had put in for a window repair back on August 14th and when the gentleman came out he fixed my kitchen window and did  a lovely job, while he was there he also had a look at my living room window as there was a rather large draft coming through and he ensured me he would need another man there in order to fix this which was fine as I didn’t originally have this booked in for a repair and being mid-august it was rather hot and this did not bother me, he then said that he would speak to the office and they would call me to let me know when my appointment to fix the window would be.2/3 weeks passed and I had heard nothing so I rang in and booked an appointment and told the lady on the phone that I had already had a repair man out and he said I would need two people to fix the window. I then had an appointment on 27th September to fix the window and you only sent one man despite me telling the lady on the phone I needed two and the lady ensuring me she had booked 2, this also wasted my time booking time off work and losing money and also I had been waiting over a month for this appointment too. I then had an appointment booked for today that has been cancelled which not one person decided to ring and inform me so again I have booked a day off work for absolutely no reason and it is disgusting how I wasn’t informed. The next appointment is now for the 30th of November 15 weeks after reporting it.There is a gap at the top of my window and it is the same temperature outside as it is inside and in 4 days I have spent £22 on electric trying to keep warm and I can’t imagine how cold it will be by the end of November. I pay my rent on time every month and how I’m being treated is appalling and disgusting.

"I have agreed to have the flooring in the toilet replaced as a good will gesture, also raised a job to fill and skim a hole where extractor was removed. "
"I have agreed with the customer to give a good will gesture of £50.00 for the inconveniance caused, i have also agreed to get the folowing works booked in - completion of damp survey works, investigation and block up of any entry points for rodents behind the kitchen sink, replace the kitchen sink base unit, replace radiator inhallway, investigaet any  potential leaks in the property. As the customer was not very engaging and non commital to the works i persaonally hand delivered a letter with all the appointments outlined and then follwed this action up with an email to ensure it was clear tha tyhe customer had recieved confirmation of the works booked in."
I have apologised as our procedure is in the process of being updated so we attend tenants with heating/hot water issues in a more timely response. i have offered £25 as Miss Lotsu has managed to source her own engineer to get the boiler up and running. 
I have apologised for the miscommunication and lack of clarity during this house move with Miss Guyah.  I have explained that clarification has been provided to the individuals and the team as a whole about 4 wks notice and appointment requirements for the Customer Hub - she took the apology and she was happy i had listened and provided clarity to the team  - clarified that Miss Guyah would like her response emailed to ehr - letter saved in folder on teams and emailed today BH
I have apologised strongly for this and empathised as this has been a stressful situation this customer was going through with no additional support from us as her landlord while trying to end a tenancy. I confirmed we did not receive formal notice of termination through our online portal even though I am not disputing it had been done and sent to us - customer has screen shots but we have never received it. If we had the process would have been started and we would have made contact. Customer was conversing throughout with Lydia Jarvis but the lettings team did not make contact due to the fact they had never received the notice. I have apologised and stated I can agree she gave notice on 22/10 which meant her tenancy was due to end after 4 weeks on 21/11/21. I have ended her tenancy on 21/11 and can see she is not in arrears/have confirmed this to her. I have confirmed this will not affect her credit rating - she was concerned about this. Arrears were generated on the account due to no tenancy end date. We received keys back on 19/11 and I would have expected the lettings team to have made contact on this date due to not having a Notice of termination in place. This did not happen and we are wrong for not making the contact and confirming the next steps/termination date. I have also apologised for this. Customer was happy with my explanation although she stated she would have returned her keys earlier if she had been contacted. I explained she would still have been liable for the four weeks rent so this would not have made a difference although it would have been closure for her so she may have had a better feeling about the ending of the tenancy. She understood everything I said and confirmed she would like the response by email so I have sent by email. 
"I have asked Nat and Scott for an explanation as to why 3 engineers attending all with different opinions of the issue.

Engineers need to ensure that reports are sent over straight away where possible following a job. Aaron went out on 2nd Feb and incorrectly put job into follow on but we never received a response back as to what works were required.

Engineers all confirmed different outcomes to the tenant at each visit which caused confusion to the tenant. We need to ensure that all engineers are consistent and ideally send the same engineer back each visit instead of 3 different engineers. "
"I have been given the go ahead to have a shower fitted in my property. I am classed as disabled and have been waiting 3 years. A man came out to do some asbestos tests and told me there wasn't enough to worry about. However, after waiting an excessive amount of time and contacting yourselves on numerous occasions, I'm still waiting. I've had a phone call from Gleivum heating who say that asbestos has to be removed from my property. This is conflicting information to what I've been told. So one person is waiting for another person or passing the buck. I have no idea what is going on, but nobody comes out and the job is not being done. I have a copy of all messages and phone correspondence that have been made to GCH over the last 2 months for further information. I am at present seeking advice on taking this matter further. It is totally infuriating. "
"I have been in with first with the service manager who assured me my housing officer has been doing great works r.e. the issue and she would be InTouch. I was then called by her on the 14th of January 2019 to be told there's an option she can do of three failed attempts to gain access to the property to even make an initial assessment. Then she could go down the court route...This is quite concerning as she was supposed to have started this process September last year and hasn't. I brought this up with her and she said she made an attempt at a visit but had been fighting fires with the handover that she hadn't done anything more? This adds insult to injury as I had already reported the hording/pest issue at the start of 2018 maybe before as advised by your tenant times booklet. So the situation now as it stands, is a year has passed and nothing has been done. This is totally unacceptable and emphasizes my lack in confidence in G.C.H. that I have previously communicated.



"
"I have been unable to contact Miss Kirwan by phone.  She does not have an email address.  This has been a long and ongoing situation and she has been in regular contact with Adam and Karen throughout this period -  calls always instigated by her.  Karen was a witness to the call that Adam took from Miss Kirwan and confirmed that Adam did not insist that Miss Kirwan should take in her sister and her son.  He was offering them alternative accommodation as he was aware that they had stayed with Miss Kirwan before and it hadnt ended well and so was trying to get them to go to alternative accommodation.  I had already written to Miss Kirwan on 30 September in relation to her insistence that GCH should be paying her for gas, electric and food.  Since the complaint came in, Miss Kirwan's sister and son have moved out, after a family row and GCH have temporarily re-housed them.  This is not something that we can discuss with Miss Kirwan."
"I have disregarded a large proportion of tenants complaint as these have been previous complaints and resolutions agreed. Tenant refused for me to visit his property and therefore i am limited to what i can investigate. I have outlined the things i can regard within the new complaint, being his windows, plastering bathroom ceiling and fire safety concerns. Have written to tenant stating multiple no access from him for us to plaster the ceiling and provided contact details for our contractor to arrange with him directly when is suitable. Windows under warranty and being dealt with. No fire concerns as have had an audit from our contractor and gloucesterhsire fire & rescue."
"I have explained to the tenant that normally this would be his responsibility but as it is possible the previous works were not carried out properly, we would get this sorted for him."
I have independently reviewed the social media posts and cannot see that we took the wrong decision to block him from our sites - i have explained my reasoning in a letter as the tenant prefers to be communicated to in this way rather than have us call him.  
I have offered £350 goodwill gesture and front door has been replaced. 
I have offered a payment of £50.00 that has been accepted for the cost of the repair done privately as a goodwill gesture (no receipts to prove this repair) and offered our apologies for the incident and any upset caused.
"I have offered Miss Oatey £120.00 in compensation to replace damaged photo frames – letter to be sent in the post.
I have committed to getting the property inspected by a damp survey as miss Oatey highlighted to me issues that were apparent due to damp. – booked for 9/12/22
Once I get the report, I will arrange for any recommendations to be completed. I anticipate more works to follow, fan upgrades at the very least.
Provide Miss Oatey with a decorating voucher for one room to cover hall wall and bedroom ceiling"
"I have raised a job with MD to have 2x New Silent 100/150 Fans fitted with PIR and overun timer of 15 minutes & a Switchee Thermostat. Also, raised a job to have bathroom basin/pedestal replaced along with the bathroom floor to be restuck. Gas engineer is also booked to attend to inspect radiators size are adequate for the rooms. Have also got her windows pushed forward to be replaced and said we will continue to come out and wash down mould until the remedial works have been complete. "
"I have raised an inspection to see whether it would be possible to have a back gate installed to your property to aid you with transporting your children from the car to the house (car parking spaces are to rear of property). 

I would also like to offer a goodwill payment of £50.00 as an apology for the time it has taken to resolve the issue. "
I have raised this with Steve Williams who in turn has spoke to Natalie Thelwell. The neighbourhood team were already looking at changing the tenancy agreement and the section on gardens has been given more detail and will be more specific on responsibilities regarding tree's
I have reviewed all correspondence to Mr Lloyd.  Whilst the tone of the letters was not bullying or harrasing I can tell Mr Lloyd was frustrated with our response so I have outlined my review of the contents of the letters in the response letter (no phonecall as he is hard of hearing). We will be taking back these garages in the future as a development requirement and I have also highlighted this as the reason we sent the NTQ to him rather than the arrears but this was only as a response to him stating the garage was unfit for purpose. I have apologised in the letter if he felt our response was unsatisfactory and said we were trying to resolve his concerns by offering him a new garage which we now know he did not want. Hopefully he will accept our apology and any bad feeling can be eradicated going forward. I have upheld as I do feel we could have softened the message rather than sending a very formal legal document with no clear explanation. 
"I have reviewed the complaint and Gas services from past 2 years were all completed correctly, no smell of gas was found or raised to us on each visit until Jan 23. We are confident that this would have had no affect on her childs health. Gas leak has been resolved."
"I have sent a letter of apology, also stated we would refer tenant to their contents insurance to cover the cost of the items damaged. See letter. "
I have spoken to the tenant and she has withdrawn her complaint. She was happy the issue had been resolved and no longer wished to pursue this.
I have written to her advising of the process and the learning we have taken but essentilly i have apologised but nothing we have done has affected or delayed her claim.  We have followed a process.  
"I provided a response which confirmed we had followed P&P and that we hadn't failed in the service provided. No evidence to suggest unprofessional behaviour/attitude from ASB Officer, however that the complainant had in fact been abusive and personal when corresponding with this Officer."
"I spoke with customer on 26/11/2020 having reviewed he complaint inc short video recordings and liaised with Service Master and the Estate Services Teams, to address the specific issues raised regarding the communal cleaning and grounds maitenance. Service Master attended the block on Weds 25/11/2020 for an inspection and a more intensive clean was arranged for Fri 27/11/2020 with the Supervisor in attendance. A further deep clean of the floors as a good will gesture has been arranged with Service Master on 8/12/2020. The Estate Services Team inspected the area and arranged for a tidy up of the external area on Fri 27/11/2020. I apologised to customer over the phone and confirmed in writing that her complaint had been upheld. Following discussion with Emma Ball on 02/12/2020 we agreed that a good will compensation payment of £50 would also be offered to customer. This offer and Compensation proforma for her to review and sign, if she wished to accept, was forwarded with the complaint response by email on 03/12/2020. I also made Karen Slater aware of the outcome as the primary point of contact for customer enquiries from this tenant."
"I spoke with Kashene Dacres over the phone and apologised for any confusion regarding the progression of the notice of tenancy termination. I confirmed that the requirement for a signed notice but that we should have backdated the notice to when the original unsigned correspondence was hand delivered to Railway House. During our telephone conversation Kashene indicated that she had moved out of F2, 1 Stratford Close and was residing at Coney Hill Road. I agreed that subject to the property being cleared and the keys being returned to RWH on Tues 23/04/19 (following the Easter Bank Holiday weekend) we would credit the rent account by x1 weeks rent. I added that if this rendered the account with a credit balance that this could be refunded via our Income Management Team. Kashene was happy with my response and thanked me for looking into the matter. I confirmed the outcome in writing on 17/04/19"
I spoke with Mr Beattie regarding his concerns that his report of an ASB incident wasn't being progressed as he had also been investigated for ASB on several occasions. I provided the reassurance that we investigate all reports to establish the facts and welcome customer feedback. As a follow up I confirmed that Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) would be the point of contact. Simon spoke with Mr Beattie to progress the matter. We also verified that the Police were taking no action regarding the report for ASB. I confirmed in writing to Mr Beattie that Simon would visit his neighbour with the local PCSO. Given that we have received a reciprocal complaint from the neighbour we've offered advice regarding a mediation approach and to refer to Restorative Gloucestershire if both parties are willing to engage. The interim conclusion based on the contact with the Police is that the reports of ASB from both parties is a fairly low level and constitutes a fall out in neighbourly relations and life style differences as opposed to ASB. We've also provided Mr Beattie with information regarding the Community Trigger if he remains dissatisfied with our approach or that of any other partners such as the Police.
"I spoke with the tenant and discussed the issues shes experienced with her boiler. Advised we have followed policy and procedure correctly and the breakdowns have been few a far between, 2 in the last 3 years. The fault F29 is not relating to safety matter. Tenant understood. I advised they are on the early appointment queue in case we have a cancellation but as i have a hour free tomorrow 13/05/2022 i will attend and have a look with an intention to repair"
"I tried phoning Miss Smith on 24/6/22 at 13.05, 13.06 and 15.10 I emailed her due to having no response on 24/6 @ 13.10 asking for contact.  no response i sent a text on 27/6 @ 16.44 no response so i called again on 28/6 @ 13.25 - Miss Smith answered and did not wish to discuss anything told me to respond in writing and hung up.  We have a resolution we hve been trying to make Miss Smith aware of stating she has been offered 41 Alvin Street and we were agreeing to remove the need for pre tenancy checks so i am putting this in writing for her and advising for her to make contact with us to complete the sign up - it was a shame she would not discuss anything with me as this could be moved on a lot quicker for her having discussed over the phone as we had come up with the solution on Tuesday 21st June - hopefully i will send the letter and she will be happy with the outcome although i am unsure if this will cover all of her points as she will not discuss "
I undertook an inspection of the issues raised. Some issues were valid and repairs have been raised for these.
"I visited Mrs Halford and explained that our operatives did not mean to cause offence, Our operatives were simply having a conversation about the condition of the bathroom floor and what could have caused the damage. The opperative who attended assured me that he was simply discussing the condition of the floor when Mrs Halford took offense, the opperative was asked to finish up and then leave her home. Our operative explained that before he left he didnt mean to cause offense but Mr Halford was not ammused and wanted him to leave. Mrs Halford was happy with how i dealt with the issue and i assured her that GCH do not want their customers to feel uncomferatble in their homess when we attend and again i appologised for any offense that may have been caused."
"I visited the property and undertook a full inspection of the porperty. Raised a number of repairs throughout the property and arranged for the gas team to attend to the boiler.
I have also arranged for a whole house decoration voucher to be issued to the resident"
I was unable to get hold of tenant to discuss complaint however I have arranged a supervisor inspection so they can go through any repairs the tenant might have.
I will feedback the learning to the individual officer and to the wider team in terms of the appropriate contact depending on the stage of your rent account/arrears and the engagement with us. For example we discussed that a phone call may have been more appropriate in your circumstances. I also confirm that we have a plan to review our suite of letters and I take on board your comments & feedback in relation to this. 
I will montior the appt for the 12th October to make sure there are no further issues and a gesture of goodwill for £25 has been agreed.
"I would suggest that if there is more than 1 live complaint from a customer that they are dealt with as one, as from a customer perspective it seems confusing - it is all GCH to them.  Also it makes it harder to investigate and try to resolve because they naturally overlap."
ICT development and CRM may help with the receipt of notices in the future with E-signatures to gradually move away from the reliance on the post service
If engineer who attended on first call checked and was  through the continued leak would not have occurred and then led to extensive damp and mould issues in the kitchen. First timefix prinicples to be reinforced via Supervisors meetings and toolbox talks. 
If vunerable/elederly tenant left overnight with out running water then arrangements to be made to supply limited amount of bottled water until supply returned to normal. More multi-Trade engineers to be employed as replacements for single trade engineers as opportunity arises and exisiting single trade engineers to be offered to be trainied up to multi-Trade standard where budgets allow. Supplies of bottled water to be purchased  and distributed to OOH operatives - to be completed by 31/08/2022
"If we get a no access from an urgent damp and mould case, then we need to be rearranging this for another 5 days. Don't wait for the tenant to contact us, let's get another appt booked in as this will stop any delays and further damage from occuring."
"If work is being carried out near items that could be damaged, then images before and after would prove items weren’t damaged. Alternatively request the tenant to move the items to a safer location.

The manager who manages Gary Allens’ contract needs to stress the repercussions of not being careful around tenants items and to move them if they can get damaged"
IL- email to Caroline advising no DPA from Ms Harris- RESPONSE- Complaintupheld. Spoke to son and explained the situation ref UPVC doors and that GCH don't carry a line of doors. Door has now been fitted. MD Group no longer carry out doors for GCH and emergency doors will now go back to Novus or Anglian. I have emailed Directors of MD to express my dissatisfaction. £500 compensation offered. Unable to speak to Miss Harrias as hangs up when I call.
"IL had previously spoken to customer earlier in the year as he called demanded a new kitchen as MD Group had told him not fit for purpose. Cheecked PIMMS, renewal dat 2027. On call, cust disclosed visual impairment affecting his use of kitchen. IL gained consent to efer to OT which was done on same day. OT riaged 3 days later determining normal priority of 12-16 weeks wait for a home visit. Had previouslye explained to Mr. Knox that there was a longer than hoped for wait for an OT, he was aware of this. Called in a few weeks later, told by CX that wait was 12-16, cust unhappy. IL called, recapped conversation previously had and that we rely on clinical expertise of our OT for triage, we won't be able to ovverride their decision.  Advised that demand exceeds capacity. Customer became angry, agitated, shouted and swore at IL. Requested email confirmation and hung up."
"IL has been dealing with customer for the past 4 weeks. Wilsons Geotech engineers have visited but need to do mapping. Nationwide have visited but no access - they offered to rebook when next in area but customer declined offer with Tina at NWD stating she was making a formal complaint. IL spoke with customer today - she was shouting and screaming. IL advised that the window survey was a missed appointment, the geotech engineer had been out and was researching and that her new kitchen was on the programme. Advised windows may not be undertaken until next financial year. Listened to call between customer and Russell Kirby, he offered to book in a repair for her window. In my call with customer 16/11 she advised RK had told her we will not be repairing but this was not the case. Customer was shouting profusely at RK and becoming very agitated. Complaint response outlines that we have again asked Nationwide to attend, kitchen date TBC with GL/MD/NKS, that doors will be changed but a report from Wilsons needs to be received first. "
IL has made complaint to MD on behalf of customer. OT referral made as customer possibly needs level access shower or improved shower tray. IL arranged for PropertyCare to attend to fix leak on toilet which has now been condemned as unsuitable for the fixings. IL has requested MD to pay £750 compensation to customer (GCH to pay initially and invoice MD) given the protracted period of time this has been ongoing and the awful customer service received. Workmanship is extremely poor and resolution will involve engaging another contractor to undertake a refurb in line with Laura Carrolls (OT) recommendation.
"IL Note- Customer is seeking several thousand £ of damages to property. MD at fault for not wiring up the boiler pump. MD advised but not response, agreed with Kelly to extend to 08/02. Response: No reply from MD, customer called IL to say they would agree to full and final settlement of £800, had been seeking £4k. This covers towels, bedding, elvis memorabilia and costs of redecoration"
"IL Note: called 22/6 hung up, letter sent for survey for 28/6"
"IL to speak to surveyors about communication with customers, particularly JP. IL always happy to help. Action issues from 3rd party surveys in a timely fashion, don't fob customers off."
"IL visited resident at home today 26/3/21. Rear bedroom is not unusable - small amount of cold bridging, no excess mould. Tenant does not open windows and has unvented tumble drier. However, all windows in the property have blown seals and a number are loose in the reveals. I believe this is attributing to the problems. To add to 21/22 window programme. Bathroom- needs replastering as promised- believe it should be done as promised and decs vouchers to follow (IL to speak with Ade White). Shed roof - not done but needs to be. Taps need replacing in downstairs WC. Also needs inspection of loft insulation above bedroom to ascertain if sitting tight or defective. IL to liaise with Jon Pickering regarding roof renewal programme. IL has advised customer that she cannot write off rent arrears as requested."
"IL visited. Very poor finish of works and IL agreed this was unacceptable. A sub-contractor is to be paid for by Snape to return on 14/04 to undertake all remedial works to customers satisfaction, IL to attend on that day also to sign off. IL found that GCH could and should have been more proactive in undertaking unannounced and announced inspections and a further post inspection upon completion. £100 compensation due to length of time and GCH accountability."
IL will: visit in conjunction with Property Care on 10/5/21; raise jobs for 2 premium extract fans; get ceiling scraped as asbestos containing material and has been left with dust flaking; engage AA Woods to remove gable end repointing. IL has offered to redecorate the lounge following the ceiling scrape and offered £250 as the matter has been ongoing for over a year.
"Important that customer are aware of GDPR requirements in terms of providing informed consent to discuss tenancy, housing or repair related issues with GCH"
Improve communication and monitoring of door replacements
Improve communication with DFG applicants as process can be long winded
Improve management of works with Leaseholder Commercial properties
improved communication between teams. IL & SS to speak to Tenancy Sustainment and other departments about differentiation between works undertaken and at void stage and routine repairs and how each need to be reported.
Improved void standards!! New procedure has already been implemented to ensure there is no repeat of these on-going issues.
Improvement in communication
In house procedure for completing recharges in place rather than 3rd party so all records of communication are stored on Serengeti and/or new CRM system
In part this was my fault and I should have managed the customers expectations from the beginning rather then letting her choose the stones. I also made a mistake when measuring the area and thought what I had ordered originally from B&Q would cover the area. To have completed the area would have cost over £400. In future I will give the customer some reasonable options for them to choose rather then letting them pick.
"Incorrect measuring of glass caused a second appointment. NB to bring this up with the carpenters, the importance of double checking measurements before ordering materials. "
Incorrect process followed for rebooking an appointment and date offered too far in advance.  Inspection had already taken place (15/12) and works planned for early in the new year.  Customer has not responded to emails or calls so investigation has taken place with no customer contact.
Independent Living Co-ordinator to visit to see what support needs - visited 29 Nov.  Information about EPC to be sent - Anthony has sent results of assessment visit.  Inspection of windows needed - Zoe making to contact to visit next week to inspect 
Individual issue with employee who is not remaining at GCH.
Information needs to be shared when a planned installation  does not happen.
"initial enquiry from Ombudsman but no complaint from tenant, so communication from will be treated as stage 1. Miss Stevens is complaining about condition of property and lack of action by GCH.  This has now also been investigated as a stage 2 and following this a stage 3 request has now also been received on 4th December 2018"
Initial work to stop leak coming from extractor fan (fitting a vented lid) has been raised. Repair to ceiling and decoration vouchers to be sent. Flue has been inspected to ensure it is correct. Awaiting dates for these works and will update tenant w/c 20/9/21 as agreed. Compensation of £250 offered and form sent via response email. Apology from Slatters will be coming later after investigation is carried out . (To seek to recover £250 from Slatters)
"Inspection by Repairs Supervisor to fully undertake a full review of listed repairs by tenant. Supervisor to provide photographic evidence of repairs, plus full list of SOR codes, timings and costings. Have asked the tenant to call Repairs and advise suitable date/time for inspection to take place. "
"Inspection date with Senior Surveyor was no accessed on 03/02/21.  A new date has been raised (22/02/21) but until the property has been assessed, we are unable to give a meaningful response. This has been highlighted in the complaint response and therefore has been marked as not upheld"
Insufficient logs were left on the account following the jobs so no clear trail was found which meant we could not locate the issues. We need to ensure we are accurately logging all calls. 
"internal transfers are a week not 4 weeks, internal comms between teams to ensure each team member has the full information about the tenants circumstances and can talk with confidence as the actions are clear and have been shared - appoitnment requirements for the customer HUB"
"Investigated fully by Jason Humphries, Anthony Ryland & Matt Dunne.  No issue found with location of 3rd party CCTV.  Confirmed in writing to complainant advising we have also ensured his neighbour is aware of the rules."
Investigation followed by swift replacement of the faulty lounge radiator. Engineer spoken with. Work due to be completed on  01/04/21. £150 compensation offered.
"Investigation is still underway. Ongoing communication with the customer regarding resolution to the complaint, which has been partially upheld. Additional visit booked to investigate further details of fly investation. Monday 07 Feb at 09.00. Agreed resolution follow visit on07-03-2022,  to have drains survey and treatment for flyin vestation if required."
"Investigation is still underway. Ongoing communication with the customer regarding resolution to the complaint, which has been upheld. Mould/Damp issues – Commission an independent specialist company to carry out a damp survey, to investigate the sources of the problems to your property and follow recommendations once made."
"Investigation proved (through Police contact) that the all available material had been made available to the police but was not required by them. Due to the customer stating she feels unsafe at Charter Court, Becky Evans has agreed that the customer can keep her Likelink pendant free of charge for a few months longer. During the complaint investigation, the customer stated that she was not happy with Jo Weavin as her ASB contact as she never gets back to her and is taking too long to look into a possible injunction. The case has now been reassingned to another officer. The customer stated that the ILO (Elaine Boothe) is being petty by asking her to take her communal rotary line down if she will not allow other residents to use it. I have agreed that Elaine is correct  as it is in a communal area - this will now be monitored. A parasol umbrella was requested by the customer for the pond area. She wanted this funded through a £30 voucher set aside for plants at Charter Court. Becky Evans has stated that she will look into approving this request.                                                                                                                               "
"Investigations are ongoing with regard to the damp and mould issues being experienced. Altough the windows referred to in the complaint are due to be replaced in 2022 financial year, all involved have stated that Ms Warranington was informed the programme would start in May, however Ms Courtney was never informed that this property would be completed in May. Asests have re-gigged the window replacement programme and this propert should now be completed in Q1 if 2022 finacial year. An independant damp survey has been authorised and recommendations will be followed or passed to Assests for actions depending on outcome. SL tried to arrange a visit to survey property to asses impact of above issues on the property and tenant. However for personal reasons to do with Miss Warrarington's partner this took until the 19/07/22 for an appointmnet to be confirmed for Thursday 21 July at 14.30 - Unfortunately on attenance no answer/access was given dispite knocking and calling on contact's mobile. "
"Iona to speak to Steve Langston about communication with Mr Lewin, Iona has a good relatoinship with mr Lewin and is happy to act as a good between"
Issue has now been resolved.  One off scenario where job was not passed out in a timely manner & difficulties reaching engineer.  Customer requested £161 compensation for loss of earnings.  As we had missed our attendance KPI & the customer had no opportunity to get to the night shift & had a lack of sleep agreed to meet part way with compensation which she was happy with.  Made it clear this was a one oif payment & would not normally offer loss of earnings.
"Issue surrounding operatives calling residents 'love' or 'sweetheart', Novus have been asked to undertake a tool box talk regarding language used as these words may be a trigger for some residents. "
Issue with materials was the root cause. This is being addressed with the contractor. Offered apologies and confirmed the fencing is now in stock.  We are pending the job at the customers request as an alternate solution may present itself through an OT Assessment.
Issue with sink now repaired and working well. Washing machine was damaged due to not being able to drain so a compensation offer of £250 has been made. This also takes into accout the ongoing issues to get the repair booked in leading to the sink not being used. Poor communication from MBM has also not helped this as the tenant was told the repair would take place w/c 29/11/21 but work was not actually carried out until 8/12/21.
"Issues for this complaint were not ""owned"" and we fell down on communication/hand-offs. We need to address all repairs on the first visit including access, ordering materials and arranging new apointments while on-site to prevent further delays. This is to be incorporated in future staff training once the new Repairs Supervisor is recruited and in post.  "
Issues to be addressed as surveyors contractor meetings on a monthly basis
Issues with communincaiton from two separate subcontractors causing to delays.   they believed they were awaiting up dates that had laready been received.  Job booked in for 2 weeks time and follow up call scheduled to ensure works have been completed.
"Issues with delays caused by not understanding the requirements of installation and the details of this not being picked up in the first, second or even third attept at installation. Although the Assets team responsible for the recommendations being followed, once jobs have been raised to repairs Assests no longer have any responsibility to see the works through. This leads to no actual person being responsible for the oversite of the works. Now on simple works/jobs this is fine, however as on this occasion the works to install the fans to the kitchen and bathroom needed jont working and understanding between the electrical contractor and GCH operatives with nither side really understanding what was required of the other, delays were incurred in ordering parts such as glass replacements and bolts to fit the extract fans in place.  Legacy IT systems also play a part in the lack of good communication between staff, contractor and tenant. "
"It appears that  when the issue was reported by the compalinant in March 22, a job was raised but not actioned. Following this formal complaint being made, a new fence has been installed between the neighbouring garden of leasehold property and our tenant at 21 Wilkes Avenue."
"It has been agreed that going forward if the ESW team spot any rubbish outside of the dedicated bin area they will collect the rubbish and place the service charge on the block, it is recognised tha tthey ESW team member was trying to be helpful however the customer was unhappy and has stated they would rather have a service charge than their rubbish being place back on their property. resident has also agreed to contact GCC to request  larger recycling bins as they are not satisfied with the size of the current binsa as they don not cover the amount of recycling produced by 6 flats. finally the ESW team have contacted GCC to remind them of their duty to empty the recycling bins every other week as they ahve a duty of care ."
It has been identified that clear communication needs to happen between customer with complaint and those dealing with the complaint to avoid things escalating. A complaint needs investigating fully and the concerns of the customer understood fully. From speaking to the customer she felt her concerns were not being listened to. As for the works carried out on the flue we have identified this was a fault of Slatters which we are still pursuing (Andy Cunnigham speaking to Slatters direct).  They are doing there own investigtion into their part and will update us with their lessons learnt. The new management team in Repairs have been made aware of how complaints should be dealt with and going forward we will take on board the lessons learned. New Repairs Manager Steve Langston will be dealing with complaints and with the help of his supervisors will ensure all complaints are handled in a timely and sensitive manner.
"It is clear that attempts have been made historically to contact the Leaseholder in the neighbouring property.  In normal situations we would look to notify the Leaseholder that due to material risk to the property, we would need to force access and recharge where appropriate.  This should have been the case once it was adjudged to be the neighbouring property that caused the issue however this does border our legal entitlements for access.  This suggests a possible error in judgement however it is very much an interpretation of the legalities of entering the property without permission and has been discussed with the leasehold manager.  Action could have been taken sooner and we have offered compensation due to damage but every effort should be made to gain confirmation before essentially forcing access. "
"It is clear that this issue had been going on for some time and I explained to the customer that they needed to stop using the shower for the short term just until the remedial works had been carried out to which the customer agreed.

From a GCH perspective as the compliant was raised due to the ooh team not raising a job for an electrician, I believe I have to produce a spreadsheet with all the issues that do require a an ooh electrician, that way there can be no way that this gets confused or left till the next day again."
It was agreed with customer that Joanne Weavin's 'Tone of Voice' via communication on the Noise APP was quite abrupt and I understood why the customer felt frustrated with her response and lack of action taken towards his complaint. He was happy for me to speak with Joanne about her attitude that evening and he was also happy for her to manage any further actions. I agreed that I would get Joanne to open an ASB case to reflect the incident on 11th July and that a warning letter would be sent to his neighbour. The customer was happy with this as on overall resolution.
It was agreed with customer that the grounds maintenance contractor (Urbaser) would not cut the area of grass and hedge for 1-4 Chaucer Close. It was made clear to  the customer that if they should change their mind on this matter they only have to ring up and advise (I have left my work mobile number). The phoneline has been reinstated (by OpenReach). I have asked if there  is anything else we can do but the customer is happy the complaint is dealt with as long as the above is agreed.
It was clear the customer had work that required completing but not clear how this was registed.  Howver call back took too long.  Apologised to customer & arranged for a precautionary asebestos check to be arranged prior to commencement of repairs.
"It was my error (Joe O'Riordan) not updating the CRM case. If this had been done the customer could have been told that we had sprayed on the 15/7/21, when they rang in on the 16/7/21. This would have prevented the customer from becoming frustrated at being told different stories. CRM case to be updated after each application of glyphosate."
It's imperative that our Customer response is maintained at all times and seemingly throw away jocular comments can have a negative impact. I've met with the colleague concerned and his Line Manager and re-iterated the thresholds for professionalism and courtesy in our interactions with customers (even during challenging conversations). As an experienced practitioner he recognised his momentary lapse
JH spoke with the tenant 8/10/20 and the complaint has been withdrawn - details have been sent to the local authority for them to respond to his comments.
"JI 13/7/20: rang complainant but she did not want to meet 17/7 to discuss. Advised that I was going out to inspect issues and investigate so deadline extended to accommodate this. Complainant simply wants money back as she feels cheated for a number of years! As it happened we did speak on the 17/7 during estate inspection and I confirmed that I was gathering information in order to put together my response. Complainant was ok with this and realised this had to be done in order for me to progress her complaint. 20/7 request for further info via Finance, ESW team and Servicemaster, awaiting feedback in order to respond. 21/7 left message with complainant to ring me back so I could provide update and keep her informed of progress & that I would respond/write out to her by 31/07/20. Response sent 30/7 giving full details of my findings and next steps. In my opinion the complaint was resolved whilst acknowledging issues around cleaning standards which have been taken up with the Contracts Manager at Servicemaster.     "
Job has been completed and offered £100 gwg for the poor service and delays. 
"Job raised to remove all plastic floor tiles to your lounge floor in order to prevent trip hazards where they have previously lifted and broken.  

Inspection raised to check the condition of the floor levels once tiles are removed to ensure no further trip hazards have been caused or where the floor is uneven arrange for a suitable repair/latex application to level off.  

Arrange for an independent damp survey to investigate the source of damp to the corner of the lounge and subsequent issues you have faced regarding carpets that have been ruined by damp and cause the floor tiles to lift in certain areas.  

Following the damp report being issued to GCH that recommendations made are following and completed as required "
Job was postponed due to another job over running. This was unavoidable as it does happen on occasion and we would not have known until part way through the appointment window.  Limited ways to avoid this in the future as this is always a risk with any job.
Jobs need to be followed from start to finish by 1 individual working closely with other departments within GCH. ST to address with supervisors 
"Jobs now booked to resolve the issues raised with windows and gaps across jobs 879920, 879919 and 879922, dated from 24/11/2021 on 28 day tickets. Awaiting outcome of works to ensure no further issues are encountered. Apology for delays given and £250 compensation plus £50 goodwill offered. 
However this offer was subsequently challenged by the tenant owing to: the lack of communication from GCH; scaffolding not being organised; complications delaying window works; drafts through window gaps (and clean-up needed after rainfall). After further discussion an increased offer of £1000 was made and accepted by the tenant."
Joe called customer. Agreed to put in key safe. Complaint rescinded
"Joe o Riordan has already spoken to Terry about the need to take his time with his work and ensure he is protecting the customers carpets and personal belongings, he has also been advised he needs to ensure he is clearing up thoroughly and wearing his PPE when working."
"Joint review completed for the complaint with Jason Humphries and Matthew Dunne as the identfied special contact for Mr Wilkinson. On meeting with colleagues and checking the systems there is no evidence that the customer has received a reduced level of service. As an organisation we continue to communicate with the customer through his preferred method of contact by forwarding correspondence in the post. We have also put in place Matthew as a point of contact for customer enquiries and reports into the business which has worked well over the past 6 months. We noted that there was an error on the legal bundle with two photos which we acknowledge and apologised to Mr Wilkinson. It's noted that at discretion we cancelled the injunction hearing in December 2020 as access was provided following 6 appointments, on the day before the court hearing."
Kathy has called in to complain about the service she received from OOH service dealing with Lifelink. Refgarding her mother Mary Gardiner- See note on file
Keep notice boards up to date - not part of complaint 
Keeping the customer reguarly updated throughout the process has assured her we were dealing with the complaint and doing all we could to resolve it. This has meant frustration did not grow and she could see a resolution was being structured. We have worked in partnership with Slatters to find a temporary solution to the heating until the gas central heating is installed early next year. Good inter-department communication was key in this and the lesson learned is that working together with clear communication is key. This collaborative approach is to be reinforced in the next complaints training session.
Kelly Healey assigned as new Independent Living Coach and will work with tenant to provide support required. Tenant knows Kelly and is happy with this arrangement
Kitchen to be placed on planned progamme for replacement. Gas supervisor to asses the heating capacity with possibility of adding to planned programme for heating upgrade. Signposted to Respirarty Health Pilot Scheme. Unable to substatiate the accusation made regarding previous surveyor who had visited property however have addressed customer service with surveyor and have noted for him not to return to property. 
Kitchen work has been approved (added to planned programme). Very little evidence to show this has been on ongoing issue however it was clear that fencing had not been addressed - surveyor to attend. Plumber to attend to fix toilet leak. Customer was exceptionally happy with the outcome.
"Kitchen works have now been agreed with Mr Newman which he is in agreeance with. Whilst visiting Mr Newman he raised other issues 1. Could his shower be adapted into a bath as he struggles washing, I have raised a CRM case (23/2/22) for assets to look inoit this. 2. Mr Newman mentioned in his letter when leaving Clapham it said about the replacement of white goods. I have emailed Laura Jone & Debbie Evans for further info on this. Although Mr Newman is happy with this I will not send confirmation letter until next week so i can hopefully add some more info on the letter. "
"Lack of communication between MessageLink, Engineer and on call Manager.  On call Duty Manager should have communicated directly with the customer to discuss the problem and taken into account the specifics of his health issue.  This may not have expedited the works but its impossible to tell.  The customers initial interactions with the engineer have not helped the situation and has given a perception of negativity also. There is a statement that he should be VB2 moving forward but no subsequent reports were found.  Apologised to the customer as a call through the DM would have been the appropriate option. Correct process was followed for no hot water or heating."
"Lack of communication, mis-information, too many people dealing with the same issue. It is a lot easier if one person takes ownership and remains constant throughout, it is easier for the tenant. "
Lack of visibilty over required works on Major Works Spreadsheet.  This needs to be reviewed more regularly.
Leak has been fixed andcompensationoffered for damge to goods family photos and inconvienience caused
Leak was nobodies fault (customer or ours) and is just unfortunate. No lessons learned and situation was resolved quickly upon learning of customers return home.
Learning objective - To listen to the tenant if they are offering advice/guidance regarding their repair. Carry out pre-inspection of job to gauge correct scope of work prior to any engineer attending. ensuring materials are ordered in advance and carrying out permanent repair first time as opposed to multiple visits. Enusre our engineers are fully briefed regarding job details/contact details. Reliant on system information being passed between systems in the most part.
"Learning point - Training SW on WRO application quality, new quality check process introduced to check for consistency. Training SW on email coporate standard & response times for customers. "
Lee D spoke with tenant 12/6/20. Airtech have now been asked to carry out a survey to address the issues she is experiencing and a copy of our condensation booklet has been sent to her. When the complaint was discussed and Lee read out the email sent on her behalf she contended this hadn't been what she had said. She was happy with the action being taken and asked for the complaint to be withdrawn. (But see further action taken column)
"Left VM to tenant and sent final resolution. Have advised i have externally sourced pest control local to the area as not satisfied with when our contractor will be able to attend. I have said on this occasion we will pay for removal and remedial works to prevent rats gaining access to property. However, in the future outlined our GCH rights ands responsibilites  confirming that it is tenants responsibility for removal of pests from the property. Also stated i will oversee until completion of the job and will call tenant to ensure they are satisifed before i leave it. "
left voicemail 30/12/22 informing that I have requested Midlands give us a date the works can be completed. Have called at the house several times with no answer. Will call in the new year once i have this date. Left further voicemail 12/01/23 informing Miss Thorne that MBM have given us a date of 17/1/23 to complete works. Works had been held up due to the poor weather which is nobodies fault. Will outline in response letter that she can contact me if she wishes to discuss further as I have been unable to contact her. 
Lesson learnt here is that post inspections need to be carried out on works done by contractors to ensure works are carried out to the expected standard. With the new Repairs Manager and supervisors in place this will be put in place. This has been spoken about and future works by contractors to be monitored.
Lesson to be learnt - Communication and ownership is key and Mr Bowyer advised he had none. We carried out work on the bathroom that led to further works required. The further work should have carried over as a follow up but instead we left the property as if all is completed. Engineer should have reported follow up work and someone then should have taken ownership and arranged the extra work straight after. Completed 21/01/2022
Lessons learnt

"Lighting is consistent with other street lighting levels, forms part of planning consent so unable to change. These also act as emergency lights for all of Clearbrook Ct."
Limited lesson that can be learnt due to the nature of the customers enquiry & being a grade 2 listed building.  Potentially a little extra communication as to what was occuring with a contractor would be helpful.
Limited on what can be learnt due to it being over 5 years old.  Resolution shoud have been reaxched quicker.
Limited to actual learnings as multiple trades team were required to diagnose fault which would have always have occured. The inspections had to be in sequence rather than concurrent as each one idenitified the need for the next.
"Listened to calls and spoke with Control Centre Team Leader. Incorrect judgement call made by operator at the time and confusion over who was attending Mrs Perry's call. Assumptions were made which led to Mrs Perry being on the floor longer than needed to be. Complaint raised to Control centre Manager and they have addressed both operators that were taking the calls at the time, with re-training being given."
"Listened to the call. Tenant was very rude and was the person shouting. The call quality was poor in part and Nationwide did raise their voice but this was consistent with the line cutting out. This was not explained to the customer. However, the customer swore at Nationwide. Nationwide did not wish to pursue this. An apology was given to the customer. I have asked Nationwide to be clearer with the customer if the line is poor as a courtesy. "
"Loft area was missed at voids stage, if this had been cleared then the rodent probplem may have been identified earlier and the issue could hThe lesson learned is that all areas need to be checked when the void team schedule the works and then checked again by the clearance team currently done by the ESW team. This message will be relayed in a meeting around voids (2/8/22) and in the next ESW team meeting. Although these matters have already been discussed informally."
"Lovell have disclaimers that residents sign but I cannot see that GCH have these readily available to refer to. IL has suggested to JP that a copy of this is held on GCH files (perhaps a folder on One Drive) so that should this happen again, GCH can easily refer. Complaint upheld as no evidence provided by Lovell in this matter."
"Lovell subcontractors were not particularly profession which caused Mr. Lewin distress. Asked Lovell not to use team on Robinsowod area, neighbour had been heard telling engineers that Mr. Lewin was a paedophile. IL to raise issue to community safety as Mr. L feels targetted by this neighbour. Job raised for NKS to adjust fenc and lay some patio slabs as goodwill gesture plus £50"
Lovells Liason Officer wil visit the project block more often to update the teants.
Managed to arrange access for scaffolding. Works to be carried out on roof to repair. Once these have been completed the internal works can be looked into and then rectified. Have explained to the customer that I will follow up on these works and keep her informed of progress. I have discussed this with her directly via a telephone call so she understands this.
Massively overgrown garden at neighbours property which occurs every year. Despite regular contact with GCH this is has never been resolved.
MAybe clarify how to effectively communicate with Mr Wilkinson without every communication ending in a complaint or being taken as a complaint
MBM have arranged the works for 24th May. Tenant is more than happy with the works being done and does not want anything further.
MD & ST to speak with customer service to be more honest and transparent when dealing with late appointments 
MD Group had previously reported the complainant had been verbally abusive towards them and had kicked their equipment. Statements were made to that affect by MD Group - equipment has been damaged. Referred to Housing Officer and ASB. No engagement by customer with IL to enable investigatation of the complaint. Katie Bird to liaise with Lydia Jarvis for a joint HO/ASB approach. It is not illegal for a shed key to be temporaily retained to get the door certified and letter dropped to that effect.
"MD Group have declined to comment on the complaint but it is obvious there is no sub contractor monitoring on this contract. GL and IL are addressing matters with MD Group, with a view to full or partial suspension of the contract."
MD Group MUST be more transparent with customers and families. Process changes agreed to minimise repeat visits.
MD have rectified any issues all within 24 hours and Slatters confirmed no exposed wires at the property. Leak was also resolved within 4 hours of being raised OOH. 
"MD to reimburse for lost wages, MD have admitted liabiity. New survey appointment arranged and confirmed."
"MD to reimburse for takeaways but they have declined to provide further compensation. Works suspended at customer request for half term. Shocking workmanship from MD, no information received from MD around who undertook this work. IL and GL to take up at director level with MD. £150 offered by GCH as goodwill (+ £100 take away reimbursement from MD). IL to oversee kitchen with GL when back on site w/c 1/11."
MD to report weekly on appointments made. GL to take up with MD
MD: Pre-surveys and pre-measures need to be provided to GCH. Issues arising from install - needs to be clearer who customers go to and communication with MD and customers needs to improve. To be taken forward with MD.
Message-Link to identify faults in their procedure when dealing with an escalation
Mis-communication on what repairs the contractor had dealt with led to an extensive delay.  Works are about to be undertaken (2/3 Dec) which have been agreed with the customer.  Customer has been encouraged to contact me directly if the issue has not been resolved as it may not be apparent straight away.  Compensation offered for replacement wall paper
Miss Barnes called in to complain about the lack of service she received when she called out the OOH engineer.
"Miss Daniels called in after receiving a text to say that the appointment she was supposed to have today had been postponed to another date.I checked the notes and it did say that the schedulers had tried to call Miss Daniels but there was no answer, I asked Miss Daniels if she had a missed call to which she said she didn’t and no message was left. Miss Daniels is unhappy that she waited in for this appointment and that she had waited nearly a month for the repair to be done (Job was raised on 28/2/19).Miss Daniels got the text about 4.30ish so had waited in all afternoon, she felt it was very late to let her know that the engineer wasn’t going to attend"
Miss Daniels is due to move out any day and at the latest 31st Oct. Miss Daniels has had ongoing damp and mould issues for years. As compensation Miss Daniels would like any recharges looked out sensitively when she moves out. Miss Daniles has explained her circumstances and I have agreed that once the property becomes void we can then evaluate the likely compensation in the form of recharges not taken forward. For example the shed is full of stuff her expartner left behind but Miss Daniels is not physically able to move/sort these items out. However although I can partially uphold the complaint due to the ongoing damp and mould issues which have been treated over the years but not resolved unfortunately at this time I have been informed that Miss Daniels is in arrears on her account  and at this time I am unable to offer compensation until this matter has been dealt with satisfactorily.  All other matters relating to outstanding jobs from th enumbers given as part of the complaint were relating another property all together. 
Miss Flynn remain unhappy about issues raised in late 2017 around the management of her housing benefit connected to homeless accommodation.
Miss Furmage called in very distraught and angry as she called in to see if the engineer outside was attending her address. I went over to check with Emily who was just calling her to let her know that we wouldn’t be attending today due to emergencies. I then went back to Miss Furmage to explain the events that have occurred in which she was very unhappy and angry as she has been messed about too much by us. I tried to reschedule for earlier however she said she couldn’t have any time off. Miss Furmage said she will be writing to Lee because she wants something done about it now. She said she reported it back on 24/1/19 and she has been nothing but messed about
Miss Harris felt that Tashan was rude in her tone and made her feel small.  She couldn't recall what Tashan had said but felt it was about the tone of the call.  
"Miss Lotsu is unhappy that she has to wait until Tuesday next week for an electrical appointment. She told me something is tripping her electric sockets but when she puts the trip switch back her sockets work.
She wanted us to come out on an emergency as she is off today , however she has electric presently and did the checks as I asked her to and told me one of her appliances had tripped it.
As she has electric and can easily get electric if it trips I did not treat it as an emergency.
She disagrees with our policies.

"Miss Mann called in to log a complaint about Aqua Construction, she states that multiple repair issues has been raised with them but few carried out. She States that Robert visited the property where the issues were highlighted (WC running constantly, bulbs blowing often in the property), Aqua promised to carry out the work but has not kept that promised, they did not attend appointments when they said they would. She is also not happy that Robert has not responded to her email regarding this matter. "
Miss Matthews believes that Mr Matthews who is her brother has gone without heating for a year. She said she believes that the radiators aren’t heating up and there is no form of heating at the address. She said she can hear the boiler firing up however can’t see any of the radiators in the property getting warm and its causing an ongoing damp issue also. She states that he is vulnerable and has been diagnosed with mental health issues and has learning difficulties and wants this dealt with as soon as possible. She states she passed the property and the wall that the damp issue was on looked saturated with water and believes a guttering system is necessary and would perhaps rectify that issue. 
Miss McMaster believe we have gave her a poor level of service since she has been a Gloucester city homes tenant earlier on this year. Miss McMaster would like to stress how she has waited 4 months for her kitchen unit to be replaced and the fact she was never updated or contacted about the appointments. 
Miss McMaster believes she has been cheated out of the space she is paying for as her garden has been split in two by a leaseholder. The Leaseholder also owns the concrete shed at the end of the garden which is on her side. She says she believes we think she doesn’t matter as she is just a tenant. Miss McMaster stated she is unaware of why the leaseholder wants a private garden when she uses the public entrance and she believes her tenancy agreement is being breached as it states she has a shared garden and now it isn’t one. 
Miss Powell is unhappy that appointments have not been met by our engineers. She advised that she has waited at home on a couple of occasions for no-one to turn up. She has contacted customer services to check and been advised of times that the engineer would attend but it did not happen.
Miss Smith has called in reporting that her shower water was going both hot and cold again following a routine appointment that was completed this morning. Cleaner had been applied to the boiler in which it should take a week or two set in where a follow up would be raised. Miss Smith explained that the engineer didn't make her aware of how long it would be. Miss Smith said she believes the engineer should've been clearer in the information she had provided her. Miss Smith is disabled and needs her wet room shower due to her disability. I have made Miss Smith aware of this however she was furious when I made her aware it would take a week to set up the next appointment. 
Miss Stevens was complaining about her picture being used in publications by GCH
Miss Webb is extremely dissatisfied with the situation regarding the fencing in her garden. She was promised 6ft fencing and is now being told she will be having chain linked fence.

"Mould issues – Commission an independent specialist company to carry out a damp survey, to investigate the sources of the problems to your property and follow recommendations once made.
Pest problems – Commission and independent block wide pest control investigation and act on recommendations made to remedy the issues
Heating and Hot water issues – On investigation and speaking to the GCH Gas Supervisor my understanding is that your boiler is one of several of the type and manufacture that have a problem with the main heat exchanger which scales up over time and causes the fault you have been experiencing. Which in other models can be solved easily, however for this model a specialist piece of equipment is required. This is currently awaiting delivery and once supplied an appointment will be made with you directly to carryout the works. "
"Moved into the property at end of June.  The next day ceiling fell in.  GCH advised it was a distorted tank.  Repaired ceiling but nothing done to the tank. Worried it could happen again.  No heating or hot water for 2 weeks.  Initially advised it was the pump but now whole heating system needs to be installed.  She and 3 children - with no heating or hot water for 2 weeks.  GCH identified asbestos in wall tiles in kitchen.  GCH stated not a problem unless they break up.  When she reported cracks in the tiles and that they had started to fall off, GCH stated this was still not a problem.  Concerned about health and safety of children.  Unsure who her Housing Officer is and cannot get any further than the receptionist when she calls GCH”"
Mr & Mrs Noah have written in to complain about the outstanding arrears on the account. These arrears are in sub accounts and she states that she thought that these accounts had been cleared as it was never brought to her attention that the amount was outstanding.
"Mr Ali, was happy to just have his heating repaired but would like to see improvements in our customer experience team and scheduling, his compliant was around poor service, however upon meeting Mr Ali he wanted to make it clear that it is not easy for people to report jobs when their English is not as good as others and as some of his neighbours do not speak English at all and they are elderly they are more vulnerable to failures in the service as they can not speak up and report these issues as well."
Mr Beatty is a close friend of Heather Hope 3/1 Munsley Close. She is recovering from cancer  surgery and was to be issued with a voucher for a bed to be supplied by  Emmaus. He said there was a delay and the voucher did not arrive so  KS  delivered the voucher by hand. Mr Beatty took it to Emmaus and was having the bed delivered by Emmaus this afternoon. However when they got there the number they had been given was  for no.6 rather than no. 3 so they refused to deliver it and took it back to the store. After a lot of co-ercing by Mr Beatty they have now said they will deliver it tomorrow morning however he wanted to make the complaint because this has now meant she has had to go longer without a comfortable bed and she is recovering from surgery.
Mr Brady has been waiting for a vehicle hard standing to be installed as they have a disable son but they have been waiting for this since February.

"Mr immins states he arrived to the appointment today and read a letter addressed to him which gave a different appointment time to that which had been agreed. He rang Lynne Phillips to make a complaint but she was on the phone and had to go through to customer service who said they would pass the message to Lynne to ring him promptly. By 12:30pm no call had been made/received so He phoned again and was told that Lynne had gone to lunch, he said it was high for discourtesy and borderline rude."

This was in October, he claims Sue W took a copy of the bill in December and told Mr Vocking not to pay it as she will sort it. Since then he has called numerous times and left messages and hasn’t heard anything back about it and has had to arrange a payment plan with them himself. "
Mr Wilkinson emailed in to complain about not being notified by letter of AGS.
Mr. W is concerned about a number of issues and we need to break down a bit more. A lot of frustration over payments being taken from his UC due to being in arrears. I have said I am happy to be a POC for asset issues and he is welcome to email me. 
"Mr.L has a complex history with GCH, will speak with JP about engineer subcontractors and 'gossiping' whilst on jobs"
"Mrs Davis is wanting to put a complaint in as this has been an ongoing issue. She has had problems since June 2018. Mrs Davis has been calling in to see what is happening with the footpath. She has a disabled Son who has been assessed by Kenny Thompson. When calling in to see what the update is, she has been told numerous times that John Pickering will call her back. There are notes on the system that supports what she is saying. Job Number: 769006. The pathway is still uneven. She states that she needs this to make life easier with mobility. "
Mrs Evans has complaint regarding the lack of communication from the surveyor despite being advised he would call. They are awaiting clarification regarding a number of jobs. They are also unhappy about workmen attending unannounced to complete fencing works. They believe that the works undertaken were substandard.

Mrs Lodge emailed customer Services saying she would like to  officially complain about how Anthony [Ryeland] dealt with her GDPR complaint concerning Jade White saying it caused extreme distress with her being present at the interview.

Mrs McCabe called in to complain about the C02 detector being out of date – she said that the electrician who has attended today has told her that it ran out of date in September 2018 (we have it runs out in September 19) and that the sensor ran out of date in 2013. Mrs McCabe is not happy that she has potentially been at risk during this time. She did identify that the Gas engineer that did her service in 2017 was one engineer that she had problems with at another property. She also sad that she had an electrician out in August over a repair to her shower (she has 2). He told her that the 2 showers run off the same switch on the fuse board and that this need to be separated out to individual switches. This work has never been done
Mrs NCube had an appointment today as she has no heating or hot water -job 780359. She had a voicemail left to say they had to re-schedule for next Thursday due to the engineer running late. She is very unhappy about this as it is going to be very cold over the next few days and thinks we should make an exception and treat it as an emergency. Mrs Ncube has no children and is not disabled or elderly so does not fulfil the criteria. I offered temp heating but she says she struggles financially and this would add to her costs which she can’t afford. She wants to raise this as she feels everyone should be emergency is this situation and should not have to be in a home with no heating for several more days.
"Mrs Ranson called in today to complain about the Glevum engineer that attended her property for a safety check this morning. She states that the engineer was very rude to her after she asked him to turn off his radio and stop humming. He states that he refused to show her his ID, when asked if she could see it, apparently the workman said it was around his neck. He proceeded to walk on her carpet with mud on his boots and upon leaving the property he stated she was “a horrible woman”. "
"Mrs Ranson of 3A Court Place would like to make a formal complaint of how she has been treated regarding the repair to her radiator. We attended on JN 784489 on the 05/12/2018 to look at leak on radiator. Simon Heal attended and reported back that a new 400 W by 700 radiator was needed and this was a stock item. We raised a new order on JN 784801 which was booked in for 04/01/2019 to replace the radiator. Tim attended today and different size radiator required which is not a stock item. Tim has now ordered the radiator and this has been sent for approval. Advised resident process of when we have materials to be ordered. Mrs Ranson feels we haven’t treated her well and she is in a priority group. Resident didn’t hear from us the day after original repair and then we were ‘on a jolly’ on the 7th December. Mrs Ranson feels we should of got to her property at 12pm today (04/01/2019) so we could of ordered a radiator and had this approved before 5pm.

"Mrs Robinson had an electrical rewire. When Mrs Robinson’s granddaughter went up in the loft, Slatters had cut a piece of the flooring up and did not repair or fix it back to the floor. They have also found some of what the engineers had for lunch left up in the loft. In some places in the bedroom, Slatters had cut the carpet around the furniture instead of moving it. Mrs Robinson had already said that she would remove things etc. to assist. There are also 3 doors in the loft were taken off and Slatters have not put them back as they were and tenant states that it’s “rubbish”. "
Mrs Thomas has emailed on behalf of her daughter Jemma Thomas to complaint regarding to ongoing issues with neighbour at 50a Winsley Road. This has culminated in a recent flood from 50a which has caused damaged to Miss Thomas's property. Mrs Thomas is extremely unhappy about our response to this.
Multiple attempts made to contact customer by phone and letter but no response.
"Multiple attempts made to contact customer by phone with no return of voicemails left.  Have sent an email & follow up letter advising if we are unable to make contact by 07/02/2020 we will close the complaint as not required.  04/02/2020 - Spoke to customer & arranged a joint inspection with GL for 10/02/2020.  Response date: 13/02/20 - Confirmed to customer agreed upon works, a specialist contactor was procured and would take place in the next financial year.  She was visited by myself & Garfield on the 10th and she made it clear her complaint was more about sustainabilty & being heard.  I have included a Tenant Panel leaflet which was discussed however there were no immediate issues with the works that we had not already outlined."
"Multiple attempts to contact customer (telephone and email) with no response. Response from Lovell passed on, apologies offered for distress and disturbance. As no customer contact unable to get any further with the distress caused to him. Toolbox talk undertaken with Lovell and Scaffolders."
Multiple visits for the same Repair need to be identified and escalated to a Supervisor/Manager with a view to improving the first time fix rate.
"Multiple visits, should have been looked at earlier. Does supplier have knowledge/capacity? Be honest with customers as to what GCH can and can't do."
"Multiple works raised as part of complaint - mould wash, grab rail to be fitted, crack around windows to be filled, block up vent and plaster, front foor to be re-hung etc "
Mutual exchange process is clear as to what is the customers responsibilty.  Supervisor viewings highlight cosmetic issues with ceiling but is clear damage has occurred since however there is no evidence to show this clearly.  We have arranged repairs as a goodwill gesture as it had become a health and safety issue.  Appointments are within  our KPI's and we will try to get done ASAP.
"My offer of resolution is as follows :- 1.	Ensure all outstanding works that have been previously agreed with Steve Langston are completed to a high standard (overseen and signed off upon completion by Steve Langston)
2.	GCH will pay Gilman’s appliance specialists to investigate and provide a report into what has caused your range cooker and washing machine to malfunction, if it is found that GCH are responsible, then we will pay for the repairs.
3.	Repair the ceiling due to the recent water leak
4.	Provide a decorating voucher to enable you to decorate the kitchen 
5.	Repair cupboard door under stairs (as mentioned to Steve Langston) 
6.	Provide a decoration voucher for the bathroom 
7.	Replace the bathroom door (you explained you were not happy with the current one since new floor has been put down).
8.	Replace small bedroom door, (you stated the wrong door was fitted previously and it did not fit correctly).
9.	Replace cupboard door on the right-hand side in larger bedroom (bedroom backs on to bathroom)
10.	Replace bedroom door ( bedroom backing on to bathroom)
11.	Provide decorating voucher for larger bedroom (bedroom that backs on to bathroom)"
"My team are due to have a meeting on 09.03.2022 to discuss communication, or the lack of, to tenants and internally. We aim to put in place a more robust process whereby tenants are kept up to date the minute we are informed of any changes to an appointment that will affect either the time of the appt or not being able to carry out the agreed work. Also, tenants UDC's to be updated to reflect that she wants AM appointments only for repairs moving forward. "

"NB Visited 2/10. Agreed works including: re-plaster bathroom, fit tiles, repair toilet leak, mould treat ceiling, instal new fan and make good affected areas. Decs voucher for 3 rooms agreed as compensation for tv unit. "
Need to address all areas of the repair including arrangement for pest control to prevent further delays - to be incorporated in future staff training once Repairs Supervisor is in post.  
"Need to be honest and accommodating with residents needs and concerns where practical, but to also advise customer on what is viable and practical."
Need to ensure communication with tenants is documented so it can be reviewed at a later date. Ensure tenants are fully aware of what is happening and that responses are listened to and recorded. 
Need to ensure jobs are correctly raised on correct operatives with correct timings. 
Need to ensure that the recharge policy is followed and that are recharges are evidenced
Need to look at how our systems are updated to make sure we are informed of consent forms
Needs to be a better system in place for when we have issues at relatively new builds as different fixtures and fittings are used to what our normal stock has – Maybe a chance to bring this up tomorrow in the meeting
New door being fitted on 3rd September 2021 - this will be the 2nd door that has been fitted with the first being fitted and primed in December 2020. There were no other call outs or emergencies raised since that date. The door does not lock because it has warped since fitting - tenant did not paint it (tenant responsibility). NB this door is not a rear access into the property but more of a gate into the area at the back.
New processes already in place to deal with damp and mould issues. 
"New stone delivered and installed, new gravel board installed and remenants of old metal fence line removed (metal post sticking out of the ground). Initial visit for complaint on 24/05/2022. Works booked for Lovells to attend on 27/05/22."
No access letter process needs to remain - no changes /learnings.
No additional learning points can be made as policy has been followed.
No answer on calls to the customer. Investigation shows only 1 previous report which was no accessed over 12 months ago. No further contact with customer since. Inspection has already been arranged within our KPI's and a condensation leaflet sent. I have agreed to monitor the subsequent repairs.  
"No authority held on account to discuss with the lady reporting the complaint on behalf of Mrs Zucha. Letter sent to Mrs Bucha confirming that repairs had now been complete and apologised that she was expecting a call back from Lynne Phillips. However, Explained that this would not normally be Lynne's area to update on and repairs could deal with it direct. "
"No call recording to validate claims on misdiagnisis so took customer at face value and apologised.  Attendance time was exceptionally quick even with additonal time spent on call.  Good opportunity for reinforcement of SLA's, diagnosing emergencies and the use of terminology.  This will be addressed at a CX Team meeting."
"No chemicals were used in the process of jetting the stack in your neighbours below property.

I have checked our records and during the period the customer began suffering with breathing problems (20th May) the following works were carried in the property below –

Flat was cleaned by Gooch group they have confirmed that the cleaning product they use would have not caused any issues from using this product this was completed on the 28/4/22.
Carpets were removed by GCH 29/4/22, this again would not have caused any issues with your breathing.

During our discussion the customer made reference to the windows of the flat being left open, this was to help with the drying process of the flat after the flood.

Floor tiles were removed on 16/5/22 from the property this was carried out by AA woods in a controlled environment due to them containing asbestos (customer does not know the fact that tile cntained asbestos)

The floors had a latex screed applied to them 19/5/22, I have had this confirmed by Gloucester carpet outlet that they have never had any reports of this causing breathing difficulties before.

There is no clear evidence that’s show that thebreathing issues have been caused by the works in the flat below, and there have been no other reports from either those carrying out the works in flat 2 or the occupier herself who was present for these jobs at the flat.

I have asked if any medical reports could be given if she wishes to discuss further. 
Emails from Gloucester carpet outlet and Midland saved in complaint response file. Have spoken to Gooch but awaiting written confirmation."
No clear GCH error.
No contact
"No contact from customer, voicemails and emails left"
"No Customer Contact-  Called mobile on 08 Feb at 17.21, 17 Feb 11.07, 18 Feb 10.43 and 21 Feb at 10.28"
No customer contact - Responses letter sent addressing concerns
No evidence of any colleagues who are related to the tenant in question. The report of benefit fraud was passed to Cotswold.gov so not looked at by GCH. ASB concerns addressed
No evidence or call recordings for customers claim of referring to youtube.  Appointment has been booked for flush within target times.  We are compliant with Electrical testing which was due this year.  Customer had 3 no accesses already but has now engaged with us and an appointment booked for January.  Third part of the complaint not included (reference solicitor) as customer confirmed this was not part of it during a call.
No failings at all from GCH. We responded within 4 hours each time the issue was raised over 2 days and the issue has been resolved fully in 2 days. 
No failings from GCH - in this situation offering compensation was not appropriate. Tenant wasn’t sure what she wanted out of the complaint but it wasn't money.
"No failings from GCH and we are not liable for the damages. Tenant has now left the property. Although there was a slight delay arranging the works, technically Scheduling followed the right process for no accesses. "
No fault found with call as schedulers followed the correct process.  Customer admitted that she had just woken up and was a little unhappy.  This was the anniversary date of the home safety check and a 3rd appointment so we would always advise the meter would be capped if access was not allowed.  Explained the process to the customer.
No formal response required.  Customer has had the work completed by Snape & was happy with the service
No history of previous reports so this was more of an enquiry as opposed to a complaint. Arranged for a fire door to be fitted due to safety concerns and an additional socket in the bedroom to reduce risk of tripping. A mould inspection was already in place (3 March) and information referred to the Housing Officer to discuss the customers concerns.

No learnings. Adherence to the void standard will ensure this type of situation does not arise - project voids are now dealt with by Property Care.
"No learnings. Delay was down to roofing works not being completed quickly and therefore causing a failure in this roofing bringing the issue to a head. Works then following the emergency had to be pulled together quickly and this was always going to be difficult at this time of year - given the weather. 
IL comment - Issues around asbestos tiles and subsequent removal by a licenced company. Notifiable so 14 days would need to elapse before removal works. Further issue was that the box gutter was actually the culprit for the leak which was not visible until roof was removed. "

No lesson to learn here as all policies and procedures were followed. Customer experience did ask for a second opinion from the repairs maanger who backed up their origional decision on whether this was classed as an ermengency. There could be a case that although not an ermengency it could fall under an urgent repair which we currently do not have in place. Meeting is booked for 15/9/22 where the emergency repairs procedure is being discussed and this is a point which will be raised then.

I have not added this in the response letter as it seens a bit demeaning but me and Iona did discuss this with them yesterday.
No lessons to learn. If leak had been mentioned an emergency would have been raised.

No specific lessons learnt as all actions have been in place and only 4 weeks have elapsed since IL visited. Customer expectations perhaps need to be managed better. IL to speak to surveyors about this.

I emailed the same day 20 December asking him for further information, which included details of what issues he thought were still outstanding and received no response to that email, so my response is based on the information that I have.  I was also aware that at the same time, he had submitted an appeal against a S21 notice for rent arrears and whilst would not speak to the officer who was dealing with the appeal by phone, did communicate with her by email once.

"None.  This was a case of the person who made the mistake (pure human error), realising this and taking full ownership to contact the customer, apologise and rebook the appointment.  This was also followed up with a telephone call after the appointment date to ensure that the tenant was satsified.  I do wonder if this approach could be replicated across the business where there are complaints that are either human error or a miscommunication - it empowers the person who has made a mistake to apologise personally and put it right and the person to hear from the actual officer.  "
not able to get hold of Mr Jessep to discuss despite several calls and emailing him.  Closed complaint in letter with option for him to contact me.  Letter also sent via email but also sent by post as he didnt respond to my previous email
Not all residents have or use a mobile phone so the customers preferred method of contact should be respected. Operatives to follow the meet and greet process( reminders given in every team meeting)
Not applicable as no contact from customer

Not to recharge for numerous items left in situ following vacation of property. Appropiate person informed.
Not upheld due to no evidence to suggest multiple enquiries. However we have agreed for a pest control company to attend based on evidence of infestation in a communal area (roof space). Customer was happy with the outcome and a letter has been sent confirming.
"Not upheld, entertainment purposes are not a reason for GCH to provide an alternative power supply during the electric being isolated for an electrical test (circa 3 hours max)"
Not upheld. Structural works are recommendations that we are not bound to and therefore do not fall under 'right to repair'. Advice/reassurance given about asbestos concerns and confirmation given that advisory roof bracing works will be undertaken (although these are not urgent/do not affect the structural integrity of the property). 
"Notes and flags on systems are key to jobs and information being shared, passed and acted on in an effective timely manner. It is clear from this investigation that cross team working and notes to support and aid others looking at the events is not clear or detailed enough.  Even if there are delays, customers have a right to be told and expectations managed. Customers to be told what the works involved are and how many visits this might take. Different use of IT systems have not helped keep theclarity of what has gone wrong with previous attempts to resolve the situation. Better cross team sharing of information and checking of details required. New Joined upsystems required - Scheduled for 2023."
Notes do suggest that we made an attempt to contact the customer to rebook the appointment on the day but no call recording will be in place to evidence this as no voicemail. The failing is more relating to the amount of time that has passed since feedback was given after the initial engineer visit.  An appointment has been booked for a supervisor to attend to scope the works correctly and a plan can then be confirmed. I have offered to accommodate the cost of the damage Gazebo due to the lack of progress from the supervisor which the customer was satisfied with.
Nothing found to support complaint - procedures followed and there were no service failure issues. No action is being taken.
Nothing found to support complaint and no service failure issues identified.
"Nothing specific learnt, a talk with the engineer will hopefully stop any of this in future."
"Nothing specific learnt, a talk with the engineer will hopefully stop any of this in future."
"Novus will issue a £50 'Goodwill Gesture' to customer. IL to draft letter to explain that IL has agreed with her complaint and there has been a service failure here. IL has liaised with Novus and it would appear that the contractual obligation of offering customers 5-7 working days notice of works to sheds and in communal areas was not carried out here. IL has set in place with Novus and agreed by Novus' contracts manager that from w/c 1/3/2021 a minimum of 5 working days (not calendar days) must be given to residents under all circumstances. GCH are to be made aware of any instances where this cannot be carried out, this may be the case due to Health & Safety. Novus have agreed to this. Customer is currently in the process of a management move. Agreed for works to be undertaken once void."
Offered £30 goodwill gesture
Offered £50 goodwill.
Offered an apology for the lack of communication and back and fourth throughout the process. Also offered £500.00 compensation but advised we would not be reimbursing the costs incurred as most would have been incurred during the process regardless
Offered to correct a range of repair works and £100.00 compensation
On review there were no lessons learnt on this occasion and the customer communication was as we would have expected. Notwithstanding this we acknowledge that refusing a household for housing is a difficult situation and not the response the customer was hoping for
"On review this seems to have been more of an enquiry than a complaint, which could have been put through for routine follow up "
On review we confirmed the complaint had been investigated under ref 546754 dated 25/01/2020. Ms Earwaker is no longer a current GCH customer having moved during December 2019. We confirmed with Ms Earwaker that the complaint had previously been investigated and the matter had been closed. We wished her well settling into her new home.
"On reviewing the complaint including a review of the phone call and a meeting with Lisa Brooks, the essence of the message regarding discarded cigarettes was relevant in terms of our landlord obligations, particulalry in relation to Fire Safety. There were elements of the phone call which could have been handled differently and which would have in all probability resulted in a different outcome, for which this has been reviewed with Lisa. We should have referenced the fire safety concerns with the customer during the phone call which would have made the conversation and messaging more staightforward. I apologised to the customer in relation to aspects of the phone communication which could have been better. Although there was no evidence of a personal attach towards the customer"
"On reviewing the complaint it was apparent that notes of the original contact from the NOK fololowing Mr Llewellyn passing away had not been kept. It's not clear whether notice was sent at this time as requested and it's likelly that there was a a break down of communication with Customer Services, the NOK and Tenancy Services. The request to provide signed 4 week contractual notice is in accordance with established practice, but the issue on this occasion were the delays in forwarding the notice of termination for the family to complete. The family agreed to clear the balance of £180.25 if the debit for the notice period was adjusted and on balance I support this request"
"On reviewing the complaint we've confirmed advice and put in place a number of actions in relation to the queries raised by the tenant. This includes a request to Property Care regarding the parking of vans and information in relation to the electric heating, a request for the stairwell area to be reviewed for potential modifications, confirmation that we will support the tenant with a Homeseeker request should he wish to complete an application, clarification that ASB reports in the locality are below average and confirmation that Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) and Debbie Preece (Housing Officer) will undertake a home visit as soon as we're able to do so following the current Lockdown due to Covid. Following a further discussion with Mr Davis on 18/11/2020 additional actions were agreed and confirmed by email, which the customer was satisifed with."
On reviewing this complaint I was able to recover the telephone call through ICT on this occasion. I also met with Paul Reilly (ASB Officer) and Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader). It was clear that Paul made a flippant remark during the lengthy phone conversation which was viewed by the customer as sarcastic. Paul recognised his error and tried to recover the situation. I support the customers view that our response on this occasion fell below the standards we expect of colleagues. As such I've upheld the complaint in full offering a full apology in writing on GCH's behalf.
On speaking with the customer he con firmed that he had no underlying issues with how Lydia Jarvis (ASB Officer) had dealt with his ASB complaint. On review its seems more information could have been gathered from the customer before raising this as a complaint.  
"On the repairs side of the complaint, repairs have been raised for the ceiling in the new year (this was already in hand before the complaint was made) There was no proof GCH or any contractor had any part in the freezer being turned off so we will not take responsibility for that, although we havve arranged for shopping vouchers to be sent to help the customer. The Neighbourhood team have tried to make contact to talk about the issues regarding the neighbour but have yet to been able to make contact."
On this case there were no lessons learnt and the appropriate Safeguarding follow up has also taken place with statutory agencies given concerns raised by GCH staff involved in the case management
"Once new Repairs Supervisor is on board they will look to review the process from first engineer visit to completion of the final element of the work, with a view to enabling ""ownership"" of the job from start to finish. Communication and transparency is required throughout the process to assure customer of full resolution."
One off error by the contractors who have reviewed internally.
One off scenario.
Ongoing disrepair case. Court ordered customer to go through GCH complaint process.
"Ongoing heating and hot water outages at St Pauls.  Discussed directly with the customer that although several fixes have been tried, a wider review of the system needs to take place due to consistent outages.  Customer was satisfied with outcome and I will arrange for his housing officer to be in contact to discuss a move."
Ongoing issues with regard to provision of electric fire within the property. Tenants are elderly and require the electric fire as an immediate form of heating. They were advised that it is not urgent as they have another form of heating. 
Only lesson that could be learned is that our contractor contacts the customer to keep them up tp date why the works are not being carried out. Although it might seem obvious to us why the works cannot be carried out this might not be so clear for the customer. I have spoken with Ian Smith from Midlands about this 11/1/23 
"Only partially upheld due to the fact that on two seperate occasions, the tenant was either ill or it was a no access - these appoinments were back in June/July of 2021, whereby if the tenant was available on those dates, this would not have dragged out so long. Agreed that the upheld part would be lack of communication from GCH. This is part of the learning objective to be discussed on 3.3.2022. "
OOH could have handled the situation better given the high number of properties involved. A reminder to OOH just remain professional and make sure call backs are carried out.
"OOH's shoud advise to switch off water, recognise it was a new heating install after being told and referred to Glevum where the work could have been done straight away.  OOH's engineer shoudl have called customer to advise running late and also passed to Glevum on attendance."
Operatives to look in more detail as I found potential access points within the the grassed area at front of properrty. Job notes only mentioned access points suggested by the customer. In future notes for operatives could also mention inspection of all areas for access points.
Opperatives need to keep their thoughts and fewelings to themselves when in our customers homes and remember tah they are there to do a job and remain polite at all time.
"Ordered a damp survey to be completed by Dave Taylor, changed boiler replacement on this years programme to a full heating system replacement and brought bathroom replacement forward to next year. Agreed with Mr Goble that remedial works following leaks from flat above with be raised after the full damp survey has been completed."
"Original failure was that request was made to the Neighbourgh hood Management Team to visit tenant in flat above to address the  bath overflowing issue that caused th eflood to No 8 in th efirst instance. As there was no Neighourhood manager appointed to this area at the time and still is not today then an alternative staff member should have responded to the request. The secondary failure was that although repair was waiting to be triggered by the visit by Neighbourhood Management when no response was recieved there was no given date to follow up and therefore the requirements were never tracked, until Mrs Ireland raised the complaint. "
"OT referral for kitchen & bathroom, needs specialist kitchen and poss LAS for daughter. JP has some money left for fencing from his budget that needs to be spent so fencing rear and front being undertaken by Lovell as goodwill gesture.  Agreed to recompense some costs for painting, plastering and removal of gas pipe in lounge and costs incurred with removal of waste from garden. Receipts provided by Ms Tanner, £750 compendation."
OT will not communicate on site regarding timescales but rather advise they will receive further communication once the stairlift has been approved with more accurate timescales.
Our systems indicate that no pest control related issues were recorded for reports from Ms Long. To review our approach to Pest control in terms of advice and support and develop this through Tenant Panel. This will be a joint review with Matt Dunne (Property Care) and Jason Humphries (Tenancy Services)
Out of hours provider did not pass job out at 05:30.  Several failures in call handling within office hours including excessive hold time.  Issue has now been resolved and works completed but apologies offered and accepted
Out of Hours to provided correct information to tenants when it comes to responsibility. 
Outcome of energy visit and outcome should be communicated to tenant together with what works are/arent proposed and likely timescales
Outstanding repairs need to be looked at and raised in a timely manner. 
"Outstanding works agreed and be to booked in with customer, compensation and good will payment offered to the customer for sofa legs."
"Outstanding works agreed, Additional decoration commisioned due to inconvienience caused to the customer"
Outstanding works have been booked for Monday 17 October - AM appointment and an offer of compensation of £250 has been made. 
"Ownership of repairs raised needs to be improved. And then followed up. Although the denial of access from the alley was not the fault of GCH, no-one followed this up and tried to resolve the issue for the customer. Have spoken to Steve Langston to discuss the lessons that need to be learnt from this. Individuals need to take responsiblity for their involvement in a job and ensure if they are unable to continue or complete works ensure the reasons are communicated to the relevant person/s and recorded via repairs system/email. If no response then should be escalated to Repairs Manager. 
There is to be a monthly review of jobs open longer than 28 days on the jobs system via a set report to be shared with Supervisors to review and action as appropriate. This is being developed and will be in place for February 2022. Review with Natalie Kirk as part of induction to ensure tracked by Scheduling team. "
Part has been ordered and an appt has been arranged for 14/03 PM. Offered £30 goodwill for the delays she has experienced.
"Partially upheld only because if that is how an officer made them feel, I cant dispute that.  It was a joint visit and the other officer did not have any cause for concern about the conduct of the NM.  Have apologied and detailed what the NM has done to assist in their noise complaint whilst also stating that we can only deal with tenancy breaches.  Information sent to customer about Community Trigger."
Partially upheld regarding engineers leaving site without any update. Apoligised for this. Letter from MD on file explaining explicitly the works oustanding and conditions required. 
"Partially upheld, Apology given regarding error in recharges"
PC are attending 23/01/2022 0800-1200 to report on what works are needed to remove level access and fit bath. Once report recieved I will send to Garf as coming out of bathrooms budget. Still waiting for date from MD to attend to cover the exposed pipework following heating upgrade. Radiator has been replaced by MD and will be returning friday 20th jan to box in the exposed heating pipes. 
PC engineers should not be using angle grinders on doors- led to needing replacement
"People involved in original inspection no longer work for GCH PropertyCare, so risk of repeat of lack of ownership has been removed. Systems of tracking information and controlling jobs could be improved with new IT systems for reporting on individual jobs etc to avoid jobs being lost or forgotten about/closed in error - I understand there are plans to develop/purchase a new Repairs Manangement system in 2022/23. Intermediate steps are being taken now to mitigate any of this type of issue moving forward. A report is being developed to check all jobs taking over 28 days to complete and this will be in place for February 2022. This will be issued to Supervisors/relevant staff to review and action as necessary. Ongoing development needed with Scheduling Team on reporting. SL to liaise with Natalie Kirk as part of induction discussions and monthly meetings"
"Per 8/6 telephone call, tenant retracted complaint following a conversation with Housing Officer - it was all a misunderstanding."
Per AG 30 Mar email - customer is to advise if he wants this complaint investigation to continue. Nothing heard from customer so Emma Ball retracted this complaint 7/4/21.
Pest control to attend and survey before carrying out a 4 week course of treatment followed by a clean. GCH to attend to locate and seal any possible rodent access points 
Pest control to attend property to get rid of pest issue. Once completed the items are to be removed from the loft by GCH and check for any damage to loft insulaton. Offer to clean carpets and sofa as gesture of goodwill.
Pictures would have been ideal to evidence what was spotted but this could have been difficult to do and could be perceived as inappropriate.
"Placed on urgent window renewal programme with Nationwide, overdue for renewal. NKS have been quote for remedial works to wet room, requires full replacement as defective. Damp Checks to attend 16/08 for reassurance visit. No evidence of rising damp but condensation. Tenant has issues with neighbour - being adressed with HO (garden overgrown) who is visiting end of July. Customer wants fencing in garden - referred to JP - no promises given as explained budget constraints, Tenant happy with this and IL to oversee works to his home. Kitchen renewal date brought forward and stock condition report does not reflect the wear and tear and multiple repairs undertaken by tenant."
Policy and procedure followed
Policy and procedure followed statisfied no complaint to answer and gave an extra 7 days to keep garage. 
Policy was followed - no learnings
Poor communication during the decant period was the primary issue. Have discussed this with the Senior Surveyor who agreed that moving forward we need to have regular touch points with decanted customers who are having major works. Process to be put in place.
"Poor communication from PC to Asset, very poor description of works required and delays with CRM case coming to asset. Extensive external works required, asset picking up (Lovell)."
"Poor communication from surveyor and Lovell RLO. Although customer advised they do not get a signal at work and cannot receive a voicemail, Lovell could have sent a letter or door knocked or sent a text message asking customer to contact. Fence to be completed before end of June. £75 offered in recognition of the delays/poor service."
"Poor communication through OT process, customer was unsure what was happening and could not get a response. OT to offer realistic time frames for works and update is timescales are greater. To advise on process of DFG timescales."
"Poor communication within teams at GCH was a contributor to the delays you experienced. To ensure that we learn from your experience, I have raised a request to ensure that all jobs which affect a private property and a GCH property, are 
carefully reviewed to ensure we are raising jobs correctly and the responsibility is identified to make sure delays do not occur."
"Poor communication, OT should perhaps speak to surveyors before recommendations made as 3rd contract now struggling to meet recommendations. RP has taken over issue with MD"
"Poor communication. This could have been resolved without raising as a formal complaint. Spoke with MD and made them aware of what had happened, they apologised for the last minute call/cancellation. They called and booked in the two appointments for the same time with Mr Birch for 21st July. Called Mr Birch on 22nd and they went ahead as planned and he was happy now. Apologised on behalf of GCH and MD. Follow up letter to be sent. "
Poor performance is being addressed with supplier.
Poor service has been addressed with contractor.  All actions by GCH were handled swiftly and to the customers expectations.
Poor service received from Contractor. Surveyor has been apprised of the issue and there are several ongoing issues with this contractor which are being addressed through formal channels. Apologised to customer and offered a goodwill gesture at the surveyors request.
Possible review of Pest Control process & recharge rates
Post inspections need booking in for all MBM works to ensure the quality of workmanship is met and to ensure the customer is satisfied with the outcome.
Potential to look at how unroadworthy vehicles parked on our land could be dealt with moving forward. A conversation has been held between team leader and staff member regarding untimely interuption  during he telephone conversation.
Power tools were left on site unattended & no notification was made from contractors advising of the works.  Apologised to customer who acceppted.  All works have now been made good.  H&S risks have been addressed with contractors who will no longer be working on site.
Pre-terminations must be compeleted with associated evidence attached
Pre-terms need to be completed on every occasion.  This has already been fed back on a recent complaint.
Previous surveyor visits did not give the same level of detail as opposed to the site visit from Matt Dunne & SImon Taylor.  ST to feedback to his surveyor some best practice.
"Prior to me visiting the tenant reg complaint, they have already had slatters out to upgrade the kitchen fan. There was also a contractor digging a trench out the back of the property as water was pooling causing what i believe was rising damp, the only works i actioned was for a bathroom fan to be upgraded and decoration vouchers issued which Simon Ward has issued. "
Priority should be given to new appointments when we have caused the delay of the repair.
Process followed was correct and attempts made to repair instead of replace were as per our policy.  This has been referred through to the surveyor for next steps of a window replacement. Appointment made.
Process followed. No learnings.
Process is already in place however reminder needed to repairs officers.
Process review taking place for Aids & Adaptations.
Process to be amended for home safety checks in voids (to include boiler testing).  Majority of repairs were unavoidable & could not be forseen.  
Project managed appropriately. No further action required
Project managed appropriately. No further action required
Project managed appropriately. No further action required
"Project void has been completed.  Surveyor met customer on site and they advised they were over the moon.  Whilst there were key extenuating circumstances, the lack of clear communicaiton or keeping the customer up to date during the extensive delays has caused the customer addtional distress.  Apologies given alongside a compensatory award."
"Project voids and regular voids to be centralised within a single team with sole accountability for void performance, application of the void standard, and management of the process. Will allow voids to be managed by a dedicated team instead of split between teams/individuals to provide greater efficiency and focus"
Properties to be fully inspected before being let to a resident including external ensuring damp course levels are not breached
Property Care Management team meeting at 1100 hours on 3.3.2022 to discuss learning objectives as we are finding more and more complaints are linked to lack of communication. UPDATE SL-10-06-2022 - Topic to be raised at next PC Management Meeting scheduled for July (date yet to be confirmed) Missed off agenda in March meeting due to volume of other priority topics to discuss. July meeting not held due to leave commitments.  Waiting on new dates for meeting to be agreed. (29/07/22)
Property Care Repairs Manager was already visiting the customer and a resolution was agreed on the day. She asked her complaint be made informal (so it was recorded but didn't need to follow the formal route).
"Property care team to be asked to only give keys to the tenant or verified household member following a lock change.  If there is not one there when lock change carried out then note should be put on door advising tenant of where they keys are and contact number for them to be collected.  Keys should be returned to Railway House where collection can be arranged.  If lock change out of hours, then trade operative may keep them with them in case tenant returns out of hours.  1/6/22 - emailed Steve Langston about lessons learnt.  "
"Property Care/ Scheduling need to be more aware of when repair jobs should be sent to asset, PC had sat on this for 6 months before disclosing to Asset. I woukd promote the use of CRM between teams more so conversations can be recorded."
PropertyCare and Assets need to work more collaboratively - tenant has been visited by numerous engineers for the issues reported but nothing has been fed back to Assets. IL to liaise with HO about flat 24 (abandoned?) and JP re. fencing. Need to promote cross business working.
PropertyCare Manager has addressed poor performance issues with contractor and met them on site.
PropertyCare Manager has addressed poor performance issues with contractor.
PropertyCare Manager has addressed poor performance issues with contractor.  
Propery to be added to roofing programme and completed before Christmas. Keep in contact with resident every 4 to ensure updates on progress and potential delays are communicated. Once roof completed reattend with PropertyCare Supervisor to agree works to be completed within property.
"Provided copy of Asbestos report to tenant who claimed this was not received when they moved in (paperwork shows this was provided but did not dispute).  Put tenants mind at ease as PC supervisor attended and given the nature of the very low grade asbestos and two small screws that had been put in, he confirmed there was no health risk to the tenant.  Open offer to the tenant to contact us should they want clarification on the areas highlighted as having asbestos in the report if they wish to work on this area.  Also confirmed appointment had been made for the light fitting.  They did not wish to have this addressed as part of the compaint as were happy with the outcome."
Quality & Standards to be monitored for internally services and against contractor services. 
Raised the issue with Service Master who attended site and visited the customer within an hour of the reported fall. ServiceMaster provided an incident report. I spoke over the phone with the complainant and her partner  and conveyed our apologies regarding the fall. Whilst ServiceMaster contend there was signage used and the floor was dry when the operatives left Chatcombe House I have upheld the complaint given the reported slip/fall on this occasion. It was noted that ServiceMaster have been prompt in terms of assisting with the investigation and on visiting the customer as a priority. I've confirmed with the complainant's partner that if she feels there have been injuries sustained due to the slip (no GP or hospital visit has taken place) then the matter will need to be referred to ServiceMaster insurers to complete an assessment. This has been confirmed with ServiceMaster and I've included the ServiceMaster contact details in my complaint response should Jo wish to pursue this course of action.
raising works as and when recieved - keeping on top of outstanding works/stock issues and escalating where necessary if it is going to fall out of our 28 day period. Communicating with the tenant. Having a system in place to follow where outstanding jobs wont get forgotten/lost. 
"Rather than reopening a case when the tenant calls, it may have been worth calling someone in the relevant department or escalating to line manager so they can have the relevant conversations. "
Realistic timescales have been given for repairs. Customer has ongoing mental health issues which manifest into physical symptoms which means multiple visits can be problematic. Ongoing ASB issues are the root cause so a subsequent agreement to reassess a management move for them was in place.  This has been agreed and the customer wants to cancel any appointments currently due to self isolating and the fact they may be out soon. If the move is likely to take longer we will need to make another plan for the works.
"Rectification works agreed to bathroom and kitchen plus filling in of concrete path previously excavated for trail pit, works to commence 09/01/2023 plus electrical safety check carried out on Tuesday 10 January 2023 - Compensation offered to the total of £870 to be paid in vouchers split between Sports Direct & Argos - Agreed with Mr Powell on 09 January 2023"
"Re-emphasised to entire team the importance of resident satisfaction. Regardless of individual roles, customer service is a priority."
"Referral to TS for possible help with the garden, Advised that pest control issues are resident responsibility. Confirmed that GCH will be replacing the toilet waste pipe - awaiting quote from MBM. Scheduling to chase and book in. Radiator job raised - prep work needed to wall. Repairs to raise. "
Referred resident to their tenancy agreement and our website Data Protection and Privacy
"Regardless of the fact that Mr B wanted his complaint withdrawn, it highlighted that where a call back note is made on a case, unless this is highlighted to the individual, they have no way of knowing that a call back is needed.  Arad Leads has raised this with Customer Experience Team to ask that they message or email the individual, if they have put a note onto a case or opened a new case that requires a call back.   I have also put a ticket on to look at how we can see if this can be auto-generated, or a callback workflow can be introduced into CRM to stop this happening."
"Regular contact needed to be made. This has been escalated to the Head of Assets/Development.  
1. Window handles and blocked vent – booked in for 28/08   2. Retaining wall and subsidence – engineer report expected 21/08   3.  Front door – sent to Iona to add to programme and order   4. Damp – part of the issue I think is down to a tumble dryer in the kitchen & partly because the airbricks are blocked. Nevertheless a job has been raised with an independent damp surveyor (16/9/20). Contact to be made by RP 24/8 once engineers report received."
Regular WIP checks required to ensure acceptable timescales are met
"Remedial works recommended to be carried out by various contractors - Tara to maintain an overview and update resident as works are booked, progressed and completed"
Repair could have been identified earlier and the issues explained to MBM more clearly as when the job was inspected it was deemed a 4 hour job when in reality it took MBM less then an hour -  email sent to Repairs management team about this aspect of the issue. MBM communication with the customer was also poor and it took me chasing personally to finally get a date booked in (Steve Langston to address in next contract meeting - Jan 2022). Completed January 2022
Repair has been booked in for 24hrs time along with a few extra bits. resident is happy with the outcome and happy that GCH will  deal with the nengineer in question. 
Repair has been carried out and customer happy with what has been done and no further action required. Email not valid so will hand deliver complaint response.
Repair was brought forward to the 27/9/19
"Repair works to be carried - sealing around lounge window, latch and lock on back gate and Blackjack paint following garden works being completed
Awaiting quotes on garden works and then instruct contractor to complete
Awaiting damp survey and then instuct works"
Repairs and immprovement works agreed with customer and also advise on how to reduce the issue.  Agreed to monitor and discuss on comlpetion of works 
Repairs completed 11/05/21. Apologised for how he felt he was treated regarding job planning/scheduling. Goodwill gesture of £75 offered for the inconvenience caused and delays. 
"Repairs have been completed.  This was complicated due to the nature of what the repairs were as it took several appointments with mulitple companies to diagnose.  Apologised to customer, brought forward appointments for as soon as possible & offered compensation due to multiple appointments. Accepted."
"Repairs have been raise with customer's agreement and mess left behind in shower from previous works to be cleaned. Sliding door which is unfit for purpose to be replaced, this will give customer with mobility issues easier access to her bathroom. Letter delivered by hand 13/10/21 by request of customer."
"Repairs have been successfully completed. Engineer who attended spoke with Ms Mayo & son and asked if there were anymore repairs that needed looking at. They did not have any but the engineer informed them to raise with us if they did. Kate Harrison (TS) has been working with Ms Mayo and helped us agree access, I have asked Kate to let us know if any future repairs are mentioned so we can work closely again to try and resolve."
Repairs ordered and compensation agreed
"Repairs raised, monitoring damp part over the next month as believe this to be historic and inspection of terrace roof to be carried out"
Repairs Supervisor already had an appointment the next working day after complaint was raised.  Customer had not registered most of the issues.  Jobs have now been raised to rectify.
Repairs were raised originally after the inspection 11/5/22 and passed to MBM. But they only received part of the works which Dave had raised. This resulted in us having to go back unecessarily on 2 occasions and caused the customer frustrations. Will be discussing this 4/11/22 with scheduling team in weekly feedback meeting to see why this was missed and how we can stop it happening again.
Repeated attempts made to contact customer. Customer then contacted to say she would be happy to have a new fob issued and leave the issue. New fob sent to customer via post and customer updated)
-Replace vinyl flooring (slate grey). As the existing vinyl is coming away and has been laid on old vinyl I propose we take it all up and start from scratch. I have asked my contractors to include a latex screed in case it is needed. Replace existing kitchen and bathroom fans with new automated fans. This will reduce the humidity in the property and therefore the likelihood of condensation and damp. Replace the skirting behind your cooker. I think there may be a leak under the bath so I have asked engineers to inspect this and repair accordingly. At the same time I have requested that we install a new bath panel.
Request for compensation following workmanship after pipework had not been replaced correctly and caused a leak
Request for installations or other services need to be checked and followed up to prevent customer concerns and complaints
requests for service to be prioritised.
"Requests from occupiers of new build properties for alterations should be formally checked against land transfer covenants. Site visits for these cases should be mandatory to avoid assumptions being made. Tenant enquiries should go to the Housing Officer (or Lynne Phillips if shared ownership property) for them to do a site visit. (Not always be necessary e.g.TV aerial/ satellite dish, but needs to be a prime consideration.) Lettings packs for new builds should have information already about alterations, but check/possibly beef that up with site specific covenants. In the absence of an obvious response the enquiry should be referred to the Development team to check the transfer documents. "
Required works raised and agreed with customer - concerns about storage of materials addressed - explained to customer how appointments are categorised and prioritised
Required works to fence/gate has been agreed with Dave Barnes at site visit. 
"Resent an engineer (GCH). No fault with valve, it was just that the valve that was not fully released. Actioned on visit, and temp ok. "
"Resident complaining about the way she was spoken to, and treated by a member of the Homeless Team"
"Resident is aware and confirmed he was aware that he was on the planned programme for kitchen replacement, advised plan ran April-March, cust unhappy so agreed to expedite, order raised to MD. Cust was unhappy with CX 'talking down' to him and forcing repairs, said this option is open if he wishes to have an interim fix. Apology and £50 goodwill gesture so upset caused. Kitchen on priority list."
Resident would like to complain that when she has spoken to housing officer regarding making a complaint in relation to repairs she has been advised the only process is to send in via writing. Resident now found out that we can take complaints over the phone.
"Resolution agreed is the same as reference 547185, plus offer of £100 compensation - Yet to be agreed by tenant. "
"Resolution not agreed, tenant is going to consult with solicitors. We will be fitting 2x enviro fans & switchee meter. Along with repairing the kitchen cupboard at void stage. I have awarded £100 as good will due to the mould damaging their old bed and side cabinets (no evidence to prove) however tenant has large recharge for 3 internal doors and an external door which her husband damaged. I investigated to see if could be waved but this was declined. Compensation form sent out."
Respond and resolve in a satisfactory timescale to prevent further disruption.
Response delayed owing in part to delay in contractor responding and in part to tenant delaying  responding to the repair/compensation offer. Nationwide to pay for sofa panel to be replaced and its transport. £350 compensation to be deducted from January Nationwide invoice to GCH.
Response emailed to customer 18.11.21. Not upheld - referral to OT was made.  Also there was no evidence of breach of confidentiality.  Upheld - issues around blockage repairs (bathroom damage caused by MBM requiring deep clean and redec) so £150 compensation for loss of earnings and £50 goodwill gesture offered. (To try and recover £150 from MBM although problem recurred 3 days after intial job.)
Response has been sent to complainants email address.  Consider incorporating a procedure to deal with police forced entry/emergency jobs involving serious incidents (and subsequent need for contacting/liasing with next of kin) into a wider procedure around deceased tenants with the aim of mitigating stress and inconvenience.
Response posted on target date due to recent visit on 05/01 at customers request.  Investigation confirmed it was poor service delivery from our subcontractor which has been addressed by the contract manager.  All bar one repair has already been completed and customer was happy with outcome.  Reimbursement for costs have been offered and as a goodwill gesture we will erect a small amount of fencing as a boundary line at the front of her grassed area.
"Responsibility did not sit with GCH, response drafted by L Phillips and sent by B Amor."
Responsibility for jobs needs to be taken and monitored to ensure works are carried out and customers are informed of any changes or delays. In this case works were raised by Repairs but not authorised/followed up by assets. Lessons are already being learnt from cases like this and a triage system is in place where CRM cases are being allocated and monitored by the Senior Surveyor.
Review of garage tenancy agreement is required and is being undertaken by Income Admin. Issue with schedulers re lack of understanding over garage process - training required.
Review works following completion to ensure all completed as required
Reviewed the ASB case with Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) on Tues 12/11/19 following a home visit to see Mr Avery by Simon on Mon 11/11/19. Confirmed with Mr Avery that we'd requested sound equipment to be deployed by the City Council over recent months and that on two occasions this had not identified excessive noise levels outside of acceptable parameters. Confirmed to the customer Simon would review the ASB case with Jo Weavin (ASB Officer). Advised the customer that they can request the activation of the Community Trigger if they remain unhappy. Apologised for the perception of poor service.
"Reviewed the complaint with colleagues and found that the process and the information given and grounds for the refusal were in accordance with established practice. The customer was informed verbally and in writing with an invitation to appeal, which they chose not to progress. Discussed with Anthony Ryland and any data shared was reasonable and in line with the Data sharing protocols that underpin the HomeSeeker Partnership. As such the Customer complaint was not upheld on this occasion"
"Rhianne/Emma All Facebook Messenger correspondence to be responded to
Rhianne/Emma All Facebook messenger correspondence to be saved to CRM, detailing who the request has been passed to and requiring an update from the appropriate Officer to the customer
Tori Change to complaints procedure – if we are putting through a complaint as a service request or informal complaint, we must notify the customer as stated in our policy
Paul Reilly/Karen Slater if complaints are being dealt with informally or as service requests, updates are still provided to customers
Paul Reilly/Karen Slater Ms Goddard notified NM that she had not received a formal complaint reference number or acknowledgement letter. This was not fed back to the complaints team. Ensure Neighbourhood Managers are communicating with the Customer Satisfaction Team when they are aware of complaints/dissatisfaction
Tori if an informal complaint has been raised previously about the same issue, it is likely that it should now be formal. Potential change to procedure to ensure this is checked."
Risk Assessments and method statements need to be adhered to by all parties (Contractors & Engineers) Contractor has been reminded of the need to adhere to Risk Assessments. In addition an all-contractor email was issued (22 May) to remind them they must adhere to the RA process and also embrace the Govt COVID 19 guidance. 
Roof repair to be carried out 18/11/21 - but may change due to ongoing police investigation in the area. Customer is aware of this and understands. Compensation of £250 offered and verbally accepted 17/11/21 plus decorating vouchers for hallway and stairwell. 
Round table discussion to take place to review the call to see how it could be handled diffently.  Feedback to be given to MessageLink
"Round table meeting between Commercial Leaseholders, Novus and GCH to agree POW and timescales. Novus have also offered an apology to GL4"
Routine assurance contact with neighbours following an incident 
"RTB - Not upheld. GCH followed correct process and customer did not respond. Audit trail on file.    
Repairs/Improvements on hold whilst RTB application was in - Not upheld.            
Future improvements - Partially upheld subject to stock condition survey and tree survey to be arranged.      
Garden/Paving - Not upheld as tenant responsibility. Customer has said the only thing that would satisfy his complaint would be to give him the property for free which is of course not going to happen. Witholding rent - not upheld.
Customer is not happy with resolution but is accepting of us investigating further. 01/12/21 Further surveys have taken place and shown no structural issue. We now also have a good idea of the difference between stock condition surveys to check against Mr Hancocks claims. DL has chased surveyors for update on elements to formulate a further response. "
"RTB process followed and correct advice given - valuation independent survey, review of this underway with the DV. GCH do not have control over these bodies and we are guided by the professional independent valuer amount and appeal of decision. "
Samples of replacement kitchen doors/frotns to be shown to tenant if a direct match to existing units isn't available.
"Sceduling team need to keep track of jobs that are running over target as although there were numerous repairs to try and fix the pump initially that the customer accepts, but the fact the job took over 6 weeks to book in and complete is far too long to go without a functioning shower. "
Schedulers and supervisors reminded of the need for good communication and to prioritise works when cancelled by GCH.
Schedulers had potential to communicate dates more effectively however customer ahs also caused delays due to clutter.  He has now agreed as per the housing officer to clear space for the contractors to work.
Schedulers need to improve communication with the tenant where there are delays
Scheduling missed the Sups email confirming the SOR. The new process we have implemented where engineers call from site to book follow on will improve this. We should also look at the process for inspections. We are always arranging inspections which takes 3 weeks and then a further month to do the works. We need to just get a better understanding of works so inspections won't be needed.
"Scheduling must ensure that all works are arranged following an inspection report.
We need a better process for when we arrange for parts as we do not follow through and chase these up until the tenant does. We need to be adding these to a spreadsheet and sending chasers every week."
scheduling team need to follow up jobs that have been subcontracted out and not just pass over to them and wait for them to be comepleted this caused the job to fall behind and then in turn allow the ciustomer to comaplian again.
"Scheduling/Repairs need to ensure that following an inspection all repairs are raised. It appears 1 aspect of the inspection was raised but the other were forgotten about. When a repair is requested and the tenant advises this has been raised previously, we need to be looking back through to see if inspections were already carried out. For a tenant to wait 3 weeks for an inspection and then another 4 weeks for the actual repair, that is too long and leads to complaints. Natalie/Laurie- Please provide feedback to your teams about being careful that all repairs are booked.

Repairs Managers  - Please review process for follow ons or appts following inspections."
Send apology letters where this type of incident occurs (leak damage to one property from another). A template letter is to be produced (to also include referral of tenants to their own contents insurance) for use by the scheduling/Housing team as appropriate.
Senior surveyor has attended and recommended a specialist damp company assesses the matter further. ADC have been instructed to attend and the customer is comfortable with what is occurring. This has been marked as partial as the process has been followed but there is a possibility it could have been highlighted sooner - however supervisors are not as qualified to assess less obvious damp issues as a surveyor.
"Service has been disjointed and although partially affected by Covid in terms of labour availability and material availability, communication from surveyor has been poor. Asbestos report completed, design for new roof completed, customer booked for new roof before end of June. Heather from Lovell to keep customer informed. £50 offered in recognition of the frustration/inconvenience suffered."
"ServiceMaster have acknowlwdged responsibilty for this and will:    Conduct a deep clean at the block on 30th June. Replace the exsisting Operatives with a new team and conduct more regular audits on the standard of future cleans. Ensure the sign in, sign out form is regularly updated with times of attendence."
Several historic issue with access after multiple attempts made to resolve the issue. Project Manager has been assigned who will work with the Housing Officer to ensure access is granted.  Customer halted works due to National Lockdown and health concerns. Re-instigated contact now Lockdown is ending to formulate new plan and timesclaes of works.
"Several measures suggested for resolution including Residents only parking sign for car park, repair / replacement door for bin area to be chased up, block letter regarding items in communal area along with targetted work by NM & ESWs, potential location of mobile CCTV."
"Several repairs to take place, including window replacement and mould/damp wash. "
Several visits were previously made but the wrong material was used to fill the holes. With a new managemet team in property care  now in place we have carried out the correct works and the lessons learned from this will be passed on to the whole repairs team during team meeting. Also pest contractors need to be chased for reports when they visit properties so we are updated and can then pass  on what is happening to the customer.
Shed can be moved and Anne (ILO) to make contact with Ms Letts to get the key. If ESW cannot move the shed (for fear of it breaking) we will purchase a new shed the same size and place it in a more accessible location for the residents to gain access. Also a new CCTV camera is to be installed by the fish pond.
Sheet for customer to sign on sign up to say they received the documentation as part of the lettings pack to reduce further risk of retunr complaints and highlighting it to incoming tenants. 
"Should we find ourselves in a psotiion where a patch is left without an NM, in the case of a Mutual Exchange, this will be reassigned to another NM (determined by capacity and workload). Due to the amount of Mutual Exchange applications received over the course of a year, this could be accomodated without causing too much pressure on the team."
"Shower chair is supplied by GIS not GCH so we cannot intervene in this. OT has referred to the community OT team, I have provided the telephone numbers to the tenant. Concrete delay implied but Monster Mix will not accept  works without a precise measure, this was undertaken on Tuesday 24th and poured 26th August."
Shower was replaced on the already booked appointment. Although customer felt it was an emergency it did not fall under this category. letter sent via email stating this and the what the customer can do next if they do not agree with my decision. 
Significant delays with no resolution. Burglary October 2021. Boarded up - October 2021. Order to Nationwide - October 2021. No updates until March 2022. Multiple CRM cases. Barely any communication with tenant. Better communication on drawn out cases. For vulnerable tenants ( HfOP) consider involving IL team as liaison?
"Simon Turner from Property Care to request that GCH Workers be more mindful when parking next to Clapham Court to carry out repairs/maintenace work. Simon Keene from the Fire Service will provide reassurance visits to Clapham Court now we are coming out of lockdown, to reassure residents that they are safe in the building."
Simon visited the property following my conversation with him and she is happy with the works agreed. Tenant has withdrawn her complaint.
"Since receiving the complaint, the Neighbourhood Manager had made contact with Mr Beattie and was able to answer his queries in relation to the service charges.  I made the NM aware that Mr B had made a complaint and when the NM phoned Mr B back (as she had promised to do) she asked him if he wanted to pursue his complaint.  Mr B advised the NM that he didnt want to.  He apologised that he had mad multiple calls to GCH because his anxiety was increased.  The NM is working with Mr B in relation to other aspects of his tenancy.  I've therefore written to Mr B to confirm that his complaint will be withdrawn however if he wishes to re-instate it, to let me know within 10 days.   21 April - Mr B had called in a number of times to speak to his NM and myself and then decided that he wished to reinstate his complaint, as advised by the ombudsman.  Complaint response sent 3 May 2022.  10 May 2022 - spoke to Mr B he is not happy with my letter.  I think he feels his complaint is separate to ""the agreement"" that he wants GCH to make in regards to his rubbish.  11 May 2022 - spoke to Joe & Katie and we all agreed that our stance hadnt changed and it should escalate to Stage 2 as what he is asking for is something that we dont and arent obligated to provide.  Mr B also went into RWH and spoke to Matt and advised him that he wished to escalate complaint."
"Site inspection followed by cctv and clean of drain system, blockaged removed from W/C pan connector (LH responsibility but removed as goodwill)"
"Site visit booked for 09/12/2020 @10.00 to check what exactly she wants to do - try to find a compromise which is allowed under planning and covenants. Post site visit - consent has been given to install some fencing. Our initial response was that we could not allow this, as it contravened the planning regulations and covenants contained within the land transfer from the developer of the site to GCH. Whilst this appeared correct and policy was followed, the visit showed that covenants would not be breached owing to the location of the fence required."
Slate has been laid instead of the black pebbles requested as the cost was to great. The patch of land was not part of Miss McLearys property but was to the side of her front lawn. 
"Slatter electrical need to demonstrate the following:

1.	Correct fault diagnoses when attending jobs that are showing a fault.
2.	Not sign jobs off as complete even if they can’t fix the issue 
3.	Not engage with our customers with negative comments about repairs or systems that GCH are responsible for.

Andy Cunningham will be raising these points in the next contract review meeting that is due to take place on Wednesday 19/10/22. "
"Slatter electrical need to update GCH with more detailed information around when materials are on order or if a fault needs more time to resolve, they also need to update the customer that reported the issue in the first instance  so they ccan be assured that the issue has not been ignored and that it is being dealt with."
"Slatters Electrical have provided us with evidence that they carry out regular tool box talks with engineers regarding covid protocol. We will be installing a new extractor fan which the tenant can turn off manually. There is no evidence from the tenant in regards to condition of property when left, nor any on engineers not wearing masks, so this has been partially upheld."
"Slatters to fit downlights, replace fans and comensation for redec- door due in 10 July"
Slatters will continue to have regular tool box talks regarding GCH protocols. as there was no evidence and the engineers denied the claims that were made against them. GCH will continue to monitor with Monthly audits.
Softer and more explanatory tone in the email may have assisted but was factually correct.  Already discussed with LH Manager
Solely down to human error. Intermittent call monitoring will also take place.
Some delays were due to Covid and the possibilty of Asebstos within the roof.  Report confirms that this was not the case and we are trying to expedite the repair as soon as the specialist roofing materials have been received.  Customer was happy with the outcome on the call today (MD 04/09/2020).
Some of the issues detailed in the disrepair cliam were not correct. I have raised works to Property Care for works that need to be completed and asked that a decoration voucher is issued following completion of these works.
Specialist PIV unit required fitting but a lack of communication from the supervisor managing has caused the customer frustration.  She did not wish to pursue any other issues.  Follow up call has been scheduled in 3 months to assess the success of the unit.
"Specialist works were required after an in depth assessment by an independent damp specialist.  There are limited learnings however there was potential for the independent surveyors to be sourced slightly earlier, this has been feedback to the team"
Spoke at length to Joseph on 24/11. Feels he is being intimidated by a member of GCH and has allegedly been following him and smiling at him in town. JB wanted this staff member sacked but explained the employee in question was on a legitamate appointment at the adjacent property. JB unhappy with this and will write to Rishi Sunak to request a review. Allegedly spoke to Michael Gove that morning who agreed the employee should be sacked and he would call again to speak to management at GCH. I advised that we would await contact and I'd also speak to JB's NM to discuss. Mental health issues appear to have got worse.
"Spoke at length to tenant who raised two primary issues. Firstly in connection with his housing situation and requirements for a two bed home. Confirmed that we would visit to undertake a provider report through the Housing Officer and forward to Homeseeker Plus, refer his case to the Tenancy Sustainment Team for help and support given the current level of rent arrears and for Paul Reilly to contact tenant to discuss any ASB reports of which we've not received any for circa 12 months. Also advised tenant that we've co-ordinated a mobile Police station at Westgate on Tues 01/09/2020 which would be an opportunity to report any concerns to the Police to establish whether there is an emerging intelligence for any drug related activity. By way of agreed action I referred the case to Paul Reilly (ASB Officer), asked the Tenancy Sustainment team to complete an assessment to provide support and advice given the customers current rent arrears. Also requested a home visit by Simone Curran to provide support and advice in relation to his Homeseeker Plus application including a Provider report due overcrowding. This is exacerbated at weekends when tenant has contact with his 3 children from a former relationship at the one bedroom flat."
"Spoke initially with the owner of Flat 1, after a long discussion we agreed to meet on Monday to provide access to the property to inspect the drains. The Leaseholder of F1 will also provide a key so remedial work will not be delayed. Mrs Merrett advised she’s happy with this but we need to consider the times she’s redecorated due to this being a reoccurring issue over a 8 year period. Agreed to fix the issue in Flat 1 and then discuss compensation for decorating and the affect this has had on her mental and physical health. Tenant happy with the response as long as we follow through with the what has been said. -  Following this i carried out an inspection as the drain CCTV proved the drains were fine, my investigation found the patio at F1 leaked into the property as it isnt sealed correctly. F2 has already arranged to move property so F2 will become a void soon. F2 has been compensated for the wardrobe she has thrown out and the decorating she has had to do. Email sent to Lynne Phillips asking for advice as the patio in F1 needs to go. Following this Lynne confirmed we installed the balcony, Rob Panau has requested the contractor to rectify"
Spoke to complainant and agreed tree was causing a health and safety issue and needed to be removed. Tree to be removed 4/9/20. Bushes to to be added to Estate service schedule and maintained ongoing on a 4 weekly cycle.
"Spoke to Mrs B on 14th April.  Agreed that new NM would visit neighbour that afternoon and contact them to update, which NM did.  Apology and action in relation to garden agreed resolution."
Spoke to Ms Richards on 13/01/2023 and advised I had listened to the telephone call and tht I did not think that Mark Phillips was rude. I listened to what she had to say and she felt he was rude. I confirmed I would send her the telephne recording and she could listen. I have sent this today together with a letter not upholding the complaint. 
Spoke to Paula - explained process of end of tenancy termination / deceased and policy which she understood (see file note for full detail) - that wasn't explained to her fully as part of initial contact via Customer Service so need to feedback back to tenancy services to ensure this forms part of the process when enquires come in.
"Spoke with complainant 22/02/2021 as part of the complaint investigation to listen to her feedback and establish how we could help resolve the issue. As part of the investigation I met with Becky Evans from the ILS Team, Becky Hayward from Income and Karen Slater from Tenancy Services. As part of the investigation we reviewed correspondence received at the Nightingale House office through the ILS team and which had not been uploaded onto the Sharepoint Library. I apologised to the complainant for this oversight. Agreed outcomes 1) Deed of Assignment paperwork sent to the complainant in Leicestershire to sign and return to RWH, which will be then signed by her mother to end the joint tenancy. 2) Confirmation that her correspondence had been received by GCH (not scanned on SharePoint) and 3) a full review of the rent account and HB entitlement completed to enable a large rent refund to be processed for her mother. I spoke with the complainant on 24th Feb and she was happy with the outcome. A further email received from the complainant on 01/03/2021 asked for a word to be added into the complaint response which was duly added. A copy of the correspondence was also sent to the mother at 32 Nightingale House as requested."
Spoke with Debbie Preece & Tara Jones during the investigation into the complaint regarding a telephone voice mail message left for the customer. On reviewing the call recording there was no evidence to suggest that the approach had been rude or aggressive. The matter had been referred to Housing from Property Care due to 'no access' to stress the importance of replacing/installing home safety detection. I also  left a voice mail message for the customer to talk through our position. Arranged a follow up home visit with Tara for the essential home safety works to be completed on Fri 03/05/19. Full complaint response sent on 29/04/19.
"Spoke with Mr Bowyer, Agreed to send plumber today 11/02/22 after 13:00 to measure up the radiator and order a new one. Spoke with MBM who will contact Mr Bowyer today too (11/02/22) to arrange the remedial work required in the bathroom. Mr Bowyer happy with the response and looks forward to getting the work done. "
"Spoke with Mr Boyd and apologised for the communication. Mr Boyd is just happy things are being resolved and that i have kept in contact. Agreed to refund Mr Boyd for the heating element of his rent from when he moved in, also agreed to refund him for the temporary heaters he used up until we repaired the broken window. Finally i advised we can issue a £50 good will payment due to the communication issues. Mr Boyd was happy with this"
Spoke with Mrs Fletcher over the phone and interviewed Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) and Jo Weavin (ASB Officer) as part of my investigation to understand our involvement. Clarified the approach we've taken for what presents as a low level breakdown of neighbourly relations on a ILS scheme due to occasional barking of Mrs Fletchers dog. I highlighted the referral for Restorative Gloucestershire to offer mediation. I was unable to review the phone recording due to the ICT issues we were experiencing at the time. During my discussion with Jo and Simon I explained Mrs Fletchers feedback regarding the customer contact. Jo provided me with an email account of the call and the aspects discussed. In the absence of the phone recording during my conversation with Mrs Fletcher and in my response corrrespondence I apologised for the perception of the contact from GCH had been dismissive. I reassured Mrs Fletcher that this hadn't been our intention and we wanted to help. 
"Spoke with Rob Panou and it wasn't him! It was Rob Newton Allen from MD. Spoke with Kiran Chawda from MD about Rob's conduct, he advised this was unacceptable. Kiran agreed with a boiler only replacement and a larger radiator only. Customer agreed. Customer wants Zack Perez to carry out the work - agreed and Zack appointed by MD. Apology given for MD conduct and distress caused."
"Spoke with tenant and listened to the call recording. Apology issued for the abrupt tone used and calling her ""rude"". The tenant wanted the officer involved to understand how she made her feel - I have agreed to discuss this with the officer along with my findings of the investigation."
"Spoke with the complainant by phone on 19/03/2021 who advised that he had been unable to establish a firm date when the property he was being considered for through Homeseeker Plus was going to be ready. I apologised to the customer in terms of the delay he had experienced and advised this was an area we were seeking to provide improvements in the quality and timing of the information provided going forward. Customer confirmed that he had received a further update from GCH on 15/03/2021, with the viewing and tenancy sign up completed on Wed 17/03/2021. He confirmed that he was happy and settling into his new home. Upheld the customer complaint, apologised in writing and identified areas of potential learning."
"Spoke with the tenant  and her partner/carer to confirm the number of attempts that GCH had made to complete a financial assessment, which for a number of reasons had been postponded/cancelled. The request from the customer was to move forward positively and I confirmed we would arrange for Tenancy Sustainment to make contact by phone to complete the financial/ affordability checks and provide relevant advice & guidance to reflect their currrent circumstances. Confirmed our agreed approach with the customer in writing and updated Corine Meier (Tenancy Sustainment Advisor) and Amanda Hayward (Housing Officer) to progress the follow up actions"
Spoke with the tenant and advise we can fit them in the diary for monday 25/04/22. Advised we will mix the plaster outside and reskim the walls then return to paint later. Advised we have tried to resolve this but the tenant is not happy with the MBM. The engineer in house wasnt able to complete the job when schedulled to as he caught covid. 
"Spoke with the tenant on 04/04/22 and agreed to visit with Iona. No damp found but a lot of mould. Agreed to cut back the bushes against the outside wall and clear the bark. REplace trickle vents, reboard and seal the bedroom window, check the downpipes and gutters as possibly blocked, reseal all other windows, check the data from the fan installed, confirm whether vent needs blocking or not in lounge, install blanking plate on socket hole,  Iona will refer the tenant to OT due to back issues. Tnt to send kin electric bill as the fan is constantly on . Once all done will arrange for mould to be cleaned off ."
"Spoke with the tenant on 10/12/20 having left a couple of voice mail messages. The customer has also spoken with Amanda Hayward (Housing Officer) at length and is satisfied that we're doing everything we reasonably can in respect of her housing application with Homeseeker Plus, with supporting information forwarded following an OT assessment in September 2020. We have arranged to visit the customer in early January 2020 at her request to review her circumstances and ascertain whether the case meets the urgent need threshold for consideration for an internal Management Move. Following discussion with the customer I have written to the City Council to support her Stage 2 appeal regarding the assessment of her Homeseeker Application"
"Spoken to partner, on planned programme and initial survey had been arranged. Repairs visit had been arranged. Partne happy with outcome"
Spoken to tenant via telephone and explained that service charges are calculated in arrears and that any reduction will be adjusted from April 2021/22. He is still not happy with this and raised a further complaint about how he was not told about the closure of communal facilities when signing up for his tenancy. (Raised as separate complaint -  Tenancy Services) Whole service letter sent out explaining the charges and closure of communal areas.
Spoken with contractor due to issue being missed. 
"Spoken with Ms Guyah.  She felt she was being fobbed off by GCH in being told to go the Council when she had got letters stating that she needed to move and how her daughter had been injured whilst bathing.   Confirmed that she had been given the correct advice as Council hold the housing waiting list and they determine the banding.  Explained that her property was safe, but unsuitable for her current needs.  She confirmed that she is also registered on Homeswapper.  She said that she understood and accepted that I would write to confirm.  She may take this further as has already been to MP.  22 April 2022 - Ms Guyah phoned to say that the information detailing our conversation was incorrect and that the child OT had not said that the wetroom should be removed and replaced with a bath.  I apologised.  She wants a new letter correcting the mistake, which I have agreed to do."
"Steps taken with contractor to improve communication, complete letter drops in the agreed upon time & ensuring ID badged are worn at all times.  Zero tolerance policy for forced entry to doors without express permission from GCH"
Subcontractor issue has been addressed directly.  
Subcontractors should be managed to the GCH standards.  They do not partner with GCH currently for this service type.
Suggested new process of Schedulders chasing inspection notes within 24 hours.
Suggested new process to Scheduling TL that all inspections are followed up by schedulgin within 24 hours to review outcomes and process any works.
"Suggestion put in to customer services on how to manage the diaries, timescales involved & information to add in."
Surveyor and Lovell to utilise other means of communication if unable to phone or leave VM. Not appropriate for customer to chase numerous times and have no response. Surveyor to action any customer communications within 48 hours or escalate to line manager if unable to assist. Line manager to keep closer eye on CRM cases for surveyor and help where required.
Surveyor has already addressed with contractor with an expectation that materials will be ready for the start of planned work.
"Surveyor should follow up to ensure materials like netting are put back up after works are completed.
Follow up with resdient on informal complaints to ensure they are happy with the outcome and agree to close the complaint."
Surveyor should have registered contact with customer to advise on why it had been delayed.  This will only become a new learning if we have another lockdown but have mentioned to the Head of Asset and Development
"Surveyors need to keep in contact with customers and ensure they are ""kept in the loop"" following visits otherwise customers assume no action is being taken and this aggravates the eventual complaint."
Swift action was taken to ensure barrier was repaired after being let down by contractor. As the issue was down to a contractor letting us down no lessons need to be learnt here but we have sourced a new contractor so similar issues can be avoided in the future.
Swifter follow up to e-mail communication
Team to make people aware of any potential hold ups & liaise with the customer throughout keeping them in the loop.
Team to make people aware of any potential hold ups & liaise with the customer throughout keeping them in the loop.
"Telephone communication with customer has been difficult, with non engagement owing to mental health issues. GCH could have done better by using other forms of communication such as letters and SMS."
Telephoned tenant and agreed to uphold the complaint but the Issues raised are to be addressed before the complaint is closed. Customer is aware of the extension. Further extension email sent 1/6/21 as agreed with HoPropertyCare (to cover Manager's leave period). On 7/6/21 Manager requested Message-Link contact resident directly to apologise for the misunderstanding and for the way the call was ended. No compensation has been offered this time round.
Temporary member of staff didn’t follow verbal advice from permanent colleague not to chase the debt - perhaps more care could be taken to ensure temporary staff follow GCH guidance.
Tenancy agreement needs to make clearer mention of customers responsibilities and this needs to be highlighted during sign ups.
Tenant  made complaints to TS manager as he was resolving her first complaint. This complaint is around lack of faith in repairs service- see note on file
"Tenant had reported neighbours garden condition on 3 July 2022 via email to an individiual staff member who had forwarded it on to the appropriate NM who had contacted the tenant about their garden.    The matter was therefore being dealt with however the failing was that the staff member did not acknowledge receipt of the email or advise Miss Dando of who the issue had been passed on to.  The NM had contacted the tenant whose garden was being complained about however could not get back to the complainant as it wasnt clear from the email forwarded on, who the complainant was."
Tenant has been given a new garage and I have offered to clear £122.57 of debt from previous garage and £400 gwg for the damaged items.
"Tenant has had a number of visits but the aerial issue has not be resolved. He has had a partial loss of service since Nov 2020 and intermittent full service losses. He has purchased aerial boosters to no avail. GCH unable to do much at current time, Tenant is understanding of this due to the scaffolding. IL has agreed to customers request for £150 compensation equivalent to 30 week service charge includes cost for TV booster. IL to keep an eye on scaffold and try to get aerial company there otherwise tenant is aware this will happen after scaffold removed."
Tenant has previously asked twice for a gate and it has been declined as does not fall under HHSRS and we need to be consistent in our approach to wht we install- future replacement/maintenance. Customer very rude and demanded to speak to NM. Hung up on me when James not available
Tenant has waited more than 6 weeks to have adaptation done and has called to chase this service several times Job Number 764887
Tenant is being moved from the property and I have offered £350 goodwill to replace her mattress.
Tenant is going to be moved to a new property due to the bed bugs issue. £250 goodwill for cost of sofa and carpet which was ruined  by bed bugs. I have offered to help move 3 appliances when a move in date has been agreed.
"Tenant is happy with the way the complaint has been managed and thanked me for my help. Has reached solutions with the contractor Lovell,s."
Tenant is unhappy with the way Lydia conducted herself on the phone and believes she shown no understanding towards her and her situation. Miss Smith stated she came across in an accusatory fashion about her parenting skills and believed Lydia was questioning her over that. Miss Smith states Lydia was very rude to both her and her sister and began to argue with each of them about the ongoing complaint. Miss Smith continued to state Lydia answered back and in an unprofessional manner. Miss Smith said she was trying to explain the situation of her daughter who has disabilities but didn’t care. Tenant also said she called her a liar.
"Tenant needs to contact utilities supplier to request a new meter, as explained to tenant previously. However given her vulnerabilities the Tenancy Sustainment team are to contact the customer to assist with resolving the issue. "
Tenant shown samples of proposed kitchen doors and fronts to show how they would compare with existing. Tenant has accepted proposed colours for replacement door & drawer fronts. Tenant resolved issue around smell themselves.
Tenant visited by Iona Lennon who deemed the property to be fine. Nicky Bullock has addressed room size needs/issues about MEX with tenant in response
Tenant was just happy that the works had been completed. I had to wait for confirmation from the tenant which she sent just after I finished yesterday which is why it was completed today. 
"Tenant was uncontactable when appointment was initially due but has confirmed during complaint process the number has not changed. Orchard has 2 different numbers, unsure which number was tried when attempting access. We should confirm tenant contact details when jobs come in incase there have been changes"
"The appointment system will be looked at to add a level of cover for rebooking jobs. if it is necessary for the job to be rescheduled, then it should only be done once for a repair and attended as agreed with the tenant on the next visit. we shouldn't rebook appointments again and the job should have a priority. "
"The bedroom voucher scheme will be reviewed over Q4 to determine whether the responsibility for assessment and issuing bedroom vouchers more appropriately sits with the Tenancy Sustainment Team, rather than the Community Investment Team"
The call was reviewed with the Housing Officer concerned with feedback provided in terms of how the call could have been handled differently to provide a more positive customer experience. Feedback also provided how calls are onboarded from different departments so that we're focused on a first time fix
"The complainant was afforded a joint viewing of a vacancy that she had bid on via Homeseeker Plus. The visit was accompanied by Laura Carroll OT to determine suitability, but unfortunately the access and layout of the 2bed house is not suitable for the customer. Having spoken to the customer she acknowledged the property would not meet her needs going forward and was appreciative of the accompanied viewing. A further joint visit will be carried out by Laura and Amanda Hayward (Housing Officer) to see if there is any further support that can be put in place at 17 Winsley Road. Karen Radford is assessed as priority Gold banding on Homeseeker Plus for rehousing. Karen is also aware of the limited options in Matson and considering on expanding her areas of choice to Coney Hill to increase the likelihood of bidding for and securing an offer of alternative housing. Karen has been provided with the points of contact at GCH should she require any further advice or support "
"The complaint highlights that contractors need to follow best practice and contractual timescales for notification of works. It has highlighted that Novus were not consistently adhering to this. This is the second occurrence of such matters. IL has spoken at length with Novus about correct procedures, which have been agreed. IL will monitor ongoing that this is the case."
The complaint highlights the importance of ensuring the all information including correspondence is added to the Sharepoint Library or as a case on CRM. This has been raised with Becky Evans to take forward with the ILS Team for information received at the scheme and locality level.
"The complaint was about GCH not receiving notice from the customer who had posted it. As the initial notice had not been received by  GCH prior to the customer handing in her keys, formal notice commences from that point. The result of this meant that she accrued former tenant arrears.
I took the view that in terms of the balance of probability this situation had not arisen due to an action or omission by the customer. Using discretion I've agreed to credit the rent account equal to the FTA balance. The csutomer has responded favourably to this offer. The rent account adjustment has been actioned by Finance"
The correct process was followed by staff although it did take a long time for the correct part to be delivered to merchants. I have picked up this issue with Buildbase and should now see a better delivery time. 
The customer complained about the management of serious tenancy issues regarding his neighbour. He also complained that he is on the VB2 list and was not aware of this or the reasons why.
"The customer experience on this occasion was that he felt rushed and that he had to sign the tenancy on the day of the viewing. Whilst our new Covid secure approach has deferred the viewing and the potential sign up to the same day, this still enables the customer to reflect if they require additional time. For Mr Carroll we didn't adequately communicate this position for which I apologised. Mr Carroll thanked me for my call "
The customer has advised that she has received a lack of communication regarding an OT referral for her mother.
The customer has complained about uneven walkways at the side of their block of flats. This resulted in them falling and caused injury.
The customer has complained that she has received a red letter regarding her rent account. She has been struggling with her health and despite this has been calling GCH and trying to keep up to date with her rent. She has missed a couple of calls from us but is upset that our approach has not taken in to consideration her current circumstances. She advised that she was willing to make a payment plan but no communication has been received from GCH regarding this.
The customer is disabled and has had works planned in for his garden to make it more accessible. The work started and has been left half done which means that the customer can no longer access his garden at all. He has chased on a number of occasions but his calls have not been returned. He is frustrated by the lack of communication and that he is unable to enjoy his garden during the summer.
The customer is unhappy about the way her ASB case has been dealt with. She has reported that she has not received call backs when promised and feels like the case in not progressing to a satisfactory outcome.
The customer is unhappy about the way in which the housing officer has approached issues regarding parking and garages erected at 132 Painswick Road. Information was also shared with the complainant regarding another person who had made a complaint which the customer identified as a breach of GDPR.
The Customer is upset that she has not been contacted by the relevant staff member to discuss her concerns with her garden. She was advised 4 weeks ago that she would receive an update and has heard nothing.
"The customer rang and spoke to Lydia Jarvis re. ""compensation agreed with Lee D"". Matt D rang him to advise we are waiting until Lee D is back 24 Feb to see what was actually agreed - LD had not recorded the compensation agreed. Matt is chasing up the potential ""moving of pipes"" work with Adrian White. 24/02/20 - visited by NB/MD, further issues with drains occured.  Management move has been agreed with Housing. Maximum award has been given due to major impact on customer with loss of property, decant, temp heating & dehumidifier costs all incorporated.  Customer was happy with the outcome."
The customer reported a number of failures in terms of planned works on his property and the lack of response in dealing with this.
"The customer reported his handset not working on 13/06/18. When Slatters attended, they advised him that he needed a new handset and so this would need to be ordered in. Since then he has had 2 further appointments to install the new handset but both times the handset has been the wrong one. He is unhappy that he has now had to stay in on so many appointment dates and yet is still waiting for the handset installation and will still need to stay in for another day when (hopefully) the correct handset arrives. He feels that this is very unprofessional and not very good customer services."
The customer reported that the path from her path to her front to side entrance had sunken in. The path by her front door was replaced but the side entrance wasn’t. As a result she stubbed her toe and would be attending A & E.
The customer was unhappy about the loud noise made by 2 engineers carrying out repairs at 1.30am.
The customer was unhappy about the process around booking a repair. Her appointment was changed on several occasions which resulted in her having to take time off work and loss of earnings.
The customer was unhappy that the engineer did not turn up for an appointment. She was advised that the engineer had been delayed and would attend in the afternoon rather than the morning. The customer was unable to be at home in the afternoon which resulted in the appointment having to be rearranged.
"The engineer in question needs to be made aware that its not acceptable advising tenants that their kitchen sides are dirty, there are ways of wording their thoughts and should speak with their supervisor if they feel they cant portray their comments thoughtfully. Regarding timescales this is due to the initial engineer not passing on whats required, the attending engineer has left the company since"
The engineer in question will be taken off of the call out rota until further notice. 
The engineer was a fairly new member of staff so extra training will be undertaken to ensure that all relevant information is passed to the tenants.
"The focus of the complaint investigation on reflection was perhaps overly centred upon the staff member involved, who has a high regard for customer servcie. Regradless of what was said during the customer contact the lessons learnt are that we need to be mindful of the percpetion. The contact with the Nelson Trust was positive throughout and there are discussions underway to utilise a trauma based approach to training for customer facing staff, which will help colleagues when dealing with vulnerable customers and challenging/complex situations. "
"The Housing Services Co-ordinator attended customers property at mutually agreed time however they did not answer the door. A calling card was left asking the customer to make contact by 8/09/2019 or the complaint would be closed. No contact received from customer, call also made by Housing Services Co-ordinator asking for customer to ring him. Received no reply."
The importance of contact management and recording customer contact from NOK in respect of a deceased tenant. The CRM phase 1 mobilisation will help in terms of contact management and basic work flow functionality
The importance of ensuring communication is maintained and appointments kept when they have been arranged.
The importance of undertaking on site property inspections when arranged to ensure works are booked and carried out effieciently. Communication with customer around process essential in ensuring positive outcome. 
"The information we initially supplied was historic (some going back as far as 2012).  Also, in the instance of the cannabis - it was a report that there was a smell but there was no substantiated evidence.  Guidance in what should be included in reference requests in future, including how far back we should be going, has been drafted and circulated to the team."
"The initial complaint letter did not include an email or phone number from Mr Robinson as was received in the post at Railway House. The complaint investigation proceeded with the review of GCH systems and records, alongside discussions with members of the Property Care and Tenancy Services Teams. This highlighted that there were no records of reports regarding mice from the late Ms Long. Noted that welfare contact had been made with the Ms Long during March and April 2020 to see if any support was required due to Covid, and there was no reference to the customer requiring support or advice regarding mice at her property. On 22/01/22 on drafting the complaint response it was noted that a recent email had been sent to the income team. Rather than forward the complaint response I sent an email to Mr Robinson and advised I would delay sending out the draft response until we had the opportunity to talk through his concerns and agree a resolution. I spoke with Mr Robinson at 8am on Mon 25/01/2022 and forwarded the full complaint response on 25/01/2022 to reflect our discussion. I confirmed that we would review our Policy approach regarding Pest Control, highlighted the development of CRM for recording case mgmt and as a good will gesture for any upset this may have caused, offered a £50 charitable contribution, which Mr Robinson indicated that Ms Long would have wished to support Guide Dogs for the Blind."
"The issue appears to be around the perceived lack of action from GCH.  This is partially true as due to the H&N restructure, there were a lack of resources to address everything and bulky items in a garden were less of a priority.  Now that the restructure is more embedded, the NM's are tackling a backlog of work both because of the restructure, where a number of staff left and there were therefore vacancies, but also from the restrictions on visits etc from Covid.  These are mitigating factors rather than lessons learnt."
"The issues the tenant has complained about were raised by myself in August last year after i went to complete an EPC on the property.  'ghosting' to internal walls, damp/mould, front garage door, and rear garage door along with guttering. Only the guttering had been done. I have located the damp report and raised the required works off the back of that with scheduling, along with the front and rear garage door. I have had a contractor out to quote for works regarding the 'ghosting'. Called tenant and they are happy with the action made. Advised i will continue to oversee until all works completed. Tenant happy for complaint to be closed if the above happens. "
The leak was caused by an accident.  No learnings to take other than to remind engineers to be careful when intenants homes . Email to be agreed to send out between SL&DS
"The leak was never reported to GCH, the only record of a repair raised was for taps that were constantly running in the bathroom above the kitchen. At no point was a leak mentioned or we would have attended as an emergency. Kitchen units are due for replacement shortly. 2016 asbestos survey confirmed there is no asbestos in the kitchen ceiling."
"The learning and reflection from the case is the recognition that a fall out or argument between neighbours can become challenging for the parties involved when reciprocal complaints are made. It reinforces the opportunity to refer to independent mediation services, but the restorative approach is contingent on everyone willing to engage. The offer remains in place for Mr Beattie"
"The learnings from this complaint are twofold. Firstly to provide Angela with feedback regarding the call to avoid the escalation of what could have been a fairly routine enquiry and whereby the customer at no stage requested to speak with a Manager. Secondly there is an opportunity to review how our Income Team manage court orders, which have been cleared but where the discharge is not included in the terms of the court order. This is a technical consideration and we need to ensure that our practices do not cause confusion or uncertainty for customers where they've acted in good faith and cleared arrears and court costs."
The learnings from this complaint for ServiceMaster are twofold. Firstly the importance of identifying welfare facilities and co-ordination of breaks for contratcors working on site all day. This has been compounded by toilets having been closed in response to the Covid 19 pandemic. Secondly ensuring that operatives are adhering to hygiene standards and conversant with the risk assessment in response to Covid 19. This has resulted in ServiceMaster cascading the information and requirements as a reminder to their Operatives.
The lesson here was learnt after David Barnes previously visited the property and installed a vent to another cupboard which has solved the issue.
"The main element of the complaint has focused around poor commication and too many staff trying to resolve and not actually understanding what the problems were. Unfortunately, as th erepair for the gutter has had to be organised for a sold property this has added to the complications in trying to resolve the situation and to effect the repair GCH have had to go out of normal proceedures to resolve the permission to carry out the works. All three elements of work required to comply with complaint raised have now beenbooked and dates agreed with respective parties.Compensation of £280 has been offered and excepted."
The main failing in this complaint was lack of communication on behalf of property care and scheduling. Assets had asked for some further informaition before agreeing to the works which was never received so the works never got raised. This is an area we are aware that there are failings. Property care and assetts to meet in the near future to discuss how we can improve how we communicate. It also has not helped that potential works had been viewed bu supervisor/managers who have then left the organisation. Moving forward with a new settled structure and better communication these historical promises should not be an issue.
The messaging for the customer could have been more succinct around fire risk in terms of discarded cigarettes. This would have provided a clear position statement to anchor our request against. The colleague involved has been updated through a debrief/coaching session. This was also cascaded to the wider team by email on 18/11/2020
"The one phone call to Mr Dudfield had been made via a works mobile which meant that there wasnt a recording of the call to listen to.  Whilst investigating the complaint, I spoke with the staff member who agreed that in hindsight, the call should have been made via Teams so it was recorded."
The only learning we can take from this is to ensure all comms are in writing and through the single point of contact at GCH
"The opportunity for a joint viewing with the ILS team in attendance with a colleague form Tenancy Services is an important consideration. Whilst this is something we try to accommodate it needs to be highlighted in terms of the value it provides in relation to the customer experience at the viewing stage. To feedback to Lee Ashmore, Becky Evans and the John Ingles of the positive impact of this collaborative approach."
The Police involvement on this occasion by the local PCSO could have been beneficial if we'd worked together. On this occasion the Police worked outside of our normal collaborative partnership approach and this could perhaps have been managed better. Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader) is discussing this with the PCSO concerned going forward. Colleagues involved in the process at the review meeting were reminded of the importance of a balanced approach to our customer contact
"The procedure on our emergency calls is currently being review, temporarily we are now attending every breakdown within 4 hours to ensure no one is going over 24 hours without hot water/ heating facilities"
The promises made to the home owner were never recorded so the maintenance of the tree's were missed. With CRM now in place we will be able to keep the records better so should stop incidents like this happening. Now the tree's are being cut to a reasonable height they can be maintained by the tenant and this will need be monitored by tenancy during estate inspections.
"The quote was correctly sent over to be approved however due to a system error, the confirmation of the request was not sent and unfortunately was therefore not approved. I have raised the issue with IT to ensure our systems are working correctly."
The repair is being completed today (14/06) and I have offered her £450. This covers the items she has lost due to the leak and the extra cost towards her electric due to having no hot water. Tenant was very happy with this. 
The request was originally made through Housing and was then repeated but this was not dealt with or passed onto the relevant team/followed up. Team need to be made aware of the importance of actioning all customer communications whether within their sphere of responsibility or passing to the appropriate team. 
The requirement is to keep track of follow-on-works and attend in a satisfactory time scale to complete. Recommended timescale 10 days - to be addressed with planning (MD) once backlog of jobs is cleared. Property Care need to speak to Assets re. the way forward when parts are found to be obsolete.
The response to the accident/complaint has been thorough and a full incident report was provided with the contractor meeting the customer through their Supervisory team. The lesson learnt is that this could have been co-ordinated as a joint visit with the Housing Officer. All other aspects have provided reassurance and the accident seems to have been as a result of the heaving rain on the day in question
The scheduling team chased the order up but as BB didnt reply the job was forgotten about. 
"The scheduling team need to implement a system whereby if jobs are cancelled by DRS then they can  be tracked somehow, I recognise this may not be straight forward but a conversation with IT may help put something simple in place, with regards customer call backs Scott Brown needs to make notes or add things to his calendar as a reminder when he receives them, or if CX take the call and want a scheduling team member to call a customer back they add the appointment in the diary of the scheduling team leader so that they can delegate."
The Service Master Team will be carrying out additional audit inspections for this block at Fairfield Court to monitor service delivery. The Estate Services Team have also discussed the feedback with the team and Amey to ensure the area is left clear and swept up following grass cutting and strimming works.
The source of the leak was missed diagnosed on several occasion and then when it was discovered it may becoming from pipework in some boxing from the privately owned flat above which was assumed to contain asbestos further delays and miss diagnosis occured. Problems of this nature are not helped by different operatives being sent following one another as the  lines of communication become blurred and miscommunication takes place. Again the legacy IT systems to not aid this process. Owner ship of the issue needs to be agreed and followed through. Unfortunately in th ecurrent structure and within exisiting IT systems and with current volumes of work with reduced staffing levls due to recruitment issues this is not always possible even if identified as a requirement. Focused approach required especially around complaints or faults that require detailed investigations.
"The tenant has had pressure issues since jan as the PRV slowly dripped but was 3 stories high  so it was hard to detact an issue at first.  Confirmed to tenant this would not affect the gas bill but the water bill maybe high, tenant adv she is on fixed rate for water. I have reviewed the gas bills, engineers comments and previous communication , i can confirm the divertor valve was faulty and heated the CH when the HW was used but this has been since the tenant went  away as she confirm each time we spoke that there was no issues with the boiler other than the pressure. I agreed to pay for the gas used whilst tenant was on holiday as the boiler should have been off but preheat on HW caused the CH to come on whilst she was away. "
The tenant has just had asbestos removed from the kitchen floor. In doing this the tenant's flooring connecting living room and front areas was removed. The tenant asked where their flooring had been taken as it was expensive and they were advised not to worry as it would be replaced like for like. The flooring was completed on 18/09/18 but the tenant was advised that metallic threshold would be put in place instead. The customer is extremely unhappy with this. 
"The tenant is concerned or has expressed some concern that he has not signed an updated Tenancy Agreement with Gloucester City Homes. The tenant stated that he had an appointment with someone called Jason, and for unknown reasons the agreement was not presented nor his tenant photos taken. (A Legitimate Interest to identify the tenant as part of the responsibilities and requirements drawn from Social Housing provision). "
The tenant is experiencing significant issues with damp and mould growth within her property. This is have a detrimental impact on her sons health and they are currently sleeping together in the living room. She is unhappy with the information she has been given by the surveyor and would like a resolution to the issues.
The tenant is unhappy about the attitude of the gas engineer who attended her property. He ignored requests from her to shut the door which resulted in her house cat escaping. She said he was very rude and did not listen to her.
The tenant is unhappy that there was a leak from the upstairs property 3 months ago and the repairs have still not been completed.
The tenant is very dissatisfied with the condition of the property when it was allocated. The Housing office undertook a 6 month check and the tenant identified a number of issues with the condition of the property and difficulties they have experienced getting the issues resolved.
"The Void letting standards had slipped, creating the issues raised. Training required plus amendments to the Void standards along with tougher post inspects prior to prospective customers viewing the properties."
The void standard needs to be reviewed around clear and cleans. Adrian White and Tony Lee have been made aware of this complaint.      
There are no lessons as this was an accident that could not have been avoided. (No communication to engineers required - they are generally very careful around customers property.)
There are no lessons to be learnt here as we are following a process which is there to protect all customers but Miss Smith refuses to take part - we have hopefully provided a suitable response by allowing her the property without going through the tennacy checks we complete for all new and existing customers   FEedback on letter provided about the type of landlord we are and access to the building - i have advised in the response that this feedback will be taken on by the governance team in a bid to take customer views.  There was no formal request for a response on these issues they were just thngs Miss Smith wished for us to think about 
"There has been some confusion over the recharge amounts owed by the tenant. Due to the time taken and confusion involved, all outstanding monies have been cleared/there are no outstanding recharges. With regard to the issue of the kitchen unit, unfortunately this is due to shortages in supply chains for a number of reasons and cannot be improved upon currently, however the tenant has been updated on several occasions relating to this. Goodwill £50 offered."
There have no failings from GCH - lack of comms from the NM however Repairs have followed the correct processes and to the correct timeframes. 
There is an ongoing issue with MBM (midlands) not communicating well with ourselves and our customers. Works were raised 22/12/21 but did not start until 14/3/22 although confusion over the asbestos report held this up slightly. But it took GCH having to chase up the works for anything to progress. This has already been spoken about during previous complaints and passed onto Steve Langston to relay to MBM whe he meets the. Regular monthly contract meetings to be held to discuss any issues with outstanding late jobs
"There is an Unacceptable User restriction in place for Mr W in which he is restricted to contacting GCH via the customer experience email or letter only and can only call in for an emergency repair.  He has been advised that the team have been instructed not to enter into discussion with you and will terminate the call if it does not relate to an emergency situation. He broke that agreement by calling in and CEx should have terminated the call, as per the restrictions.   In addition the rest of the business should be mindful when they send out letters to him to not encourage him to phone in but go via the agreed channels."
There is clear evidence from the Tenancy Sustainment Team of attempts to contact the customer over a number of months. The ability to monitor the outstanding task or closure for non engagement with the customer is 'smarter' with CRM in place for contact/case management. No specific learnings/actions.
There is no record of who from GHC or which team may have given the advice that the gate was the tenant's responsibility.  Action required to ensure GCH responsibilities are understood by all teams dealing with repair issues. Put on PropertyCare agenda  to brief at next Supervisors meeting. 
There is the potential for some marketing work from Homeseeker Plus and the development of the Customer Service portal which would provide additional information about the bidding process and help to manage customers expectations
There needs to be a consistent approach to housekeeping and Health & Safety by contractors when completing works within the blocks. The complaint has also highlighted the need for the cleaning schedules to be displayed within the block.
There was a slight delay (x1 day) on the basis that we experienced ICT problems during this period and phone recordings could not be recovered. Spoke with the customer initially and offered her the property she was seeking on the basis she had appeared on a second shortlisting with GCH. This would have provided the resolutions she was seeking and illustrated that offers can be afforded to customers at the end of the CBL bidding cycle. Having reviewed the phone calls made by Jack Murphy I'm satisfied that the advice given reflected good customer service. I also forwarded the complaint to Michelle Wheatley (Housing Team Leader at GCC) as the feedback reflected the customers Homeseeker Application which is administered by the City Council.
There was no resolution to be had.  There was an objection to something we had done in order to secure a tenants property .  They objected to what we had done but we had done nothing untoward - the only thing we could have done differently was to write to the customer to advise (which we are under no liberty to do) and due to the nature of the customers interaction with us we felt we were unable to do this 
There were no lessons learnt as this was not a complaint about poor service by Homes & Neighbourhood. The complaint related to frustrations with Homeseeker (GCC).
There were no lessons learnt. We have continued to support the customer through the RTB process.
There were no specific lessons on this occasion with the complaint having been investigated in January 2019. At the time the case management responsibility as the primary point of contact for the customer was changed to Simon Boden (ASB Team Leader)
There were significant delays receiving the report following the initial job on the 4th of October which resulted in a 2 month delay getting the radiator repaired. 
Third party contractors agreed this was a mistake.  They have compensated he customer directly with an agreed amount based on evidence of items lost from previous photos. 
This complaint arose following an unkept promise made by a previous member of GCH Staff to a resident affected by ASB from one of our tenants. I have reviewed emails between Simon Boden and the resident which evidence approval of a fence in the rear garden. Moving forward I feel it would be a good idea to have a tab in CRM which encapsulates promises or agreements with customers to avoid similar complaints being made. EB taking forward with NM.
"This complaint had been raised previously with JH in February 2021. I have responded acccordingly and noted lthe responses provided in the letter dated 04/03/21. (There is no evidence of differing treatment, customer has the right to provide defence against the NOSP and there is no evidence of PR acting in a manner which would present a conflict of interest.)"
This complaint has been rescinded by the customer.  No further action is required and she was happy after the engineer attended.
"This complaint has raised a few questions around communication and whether or not we are doing all we can as the property care team to facilitate appointments even if they were missed. My investigation found that the engineer had left Mr Davis's property and then went to another job, however by looking in to the van tracker for the engineer in question i found that there was 2.5 hours spent over the course of the day at build base, furthermore when the appointment was missed our engineer did not leave a no access card as they did not have any left.  Finally when Mr Davis was told that a manager would make contact with him as he requested they do so, he was expecting someone to call him on that day. The learning outcomes on this are as follows : Scheduling team / customer experience team (whoever takes the call) need to ensure they are communicating with the works supervisors of the engineers that are out in the field to ensure they are supposed to be where they say they are and to ascertain or gauge whether the engineer can get back to the missed appointment or not. 2nd point ensure that when GCH call handlers are dealing with the customer we are managing their expectations, MR Davis was adamant he was getting a call back from a manger that day, however we need to be clear if a manager is going to call back or better still try and call the works supervisor who is in the field to make contact with the customer to update him with what is happening, I feel Mr Davis would have felt more valued had we made the effort to get someone with authority to return his call on that day, I recognise the appointment may not have been attended again that day, however Mr Davis would have been better informed as to when the next appointment would be and I am sure we would have been more conscious that it was completed to avoid further frustration. My Final learning outcome is that of when we book engineers to attend jobs that are follow ups to a complaint, we need to come up with a solution that prevents the attending engineer from being bogged down with  emergencies until he has completed the repair linked to the compliant, Sam Grmiwood was the attending engineer on the day of the repair and nearly missed the slot due to emergencies being put on him. Update SL SL - 10/06/22 Structure of Supervisors responsibilities have been re-organised and strengthend to better support incoming issues to GCH - First line of contact is now to Supervisors areas of responsibilities i.e split between odd.even number properties, If for whatever reason the first line Supervisor cannot respond,the other Supervisor should with in 24 hrs. Last line of response is with the Repairs Manaager to respond or if immediate action is required due to nature or sensativity of call/issue. In place as of 01 June."
This complaint was raised after a repair had been completed and the customer was seeking assurance that it would not reoccur. This highlighted the importance of good communication and we are working with the customer to ensure that all other repairs raised are completed. SL Liaised with Mr Lwein to offer reassurance as to resolution of situation as part of complaint resolution. Completed March 2022
This complaint went to a stage 2 which rob is dealing with. I carried out the EPC which the results were within our target. I also drilled into the cavity wall and confirmed that there was insulation. The air source heating had been inspected by an engineer and was all in working order. I therefore closed the complaint after consulting with Rob that the investigations had been exausted. 
This disrepair came of the back of glazing which needed to be replaced in the front door originally raised in August 2022 but works were not compelted until May 2023 leading to the disrepair company making contact with the resident and putting in a claim. We need to deal with repairs in a more timely manor and keep the resident informed. 
This has been an ongoing issue which dates back to 2019. Several GCH employees have been involved with none really seeing the job through. GCH as a whole could learn a lesson in ownership here. Emma to consider using this as a case study for complaints training/post onto Teams site.
This has been upheld as although not a direct GCH fault the customer had several major issues in the property.  Whilst we potentially could have worked around them or even decanted them however with the extent of the work our Asset Team many review what we do with the property longer term to see if it still viable.  A management move has been agreed  through housing and we will compensate them for the move by arranging carpets & a removal company. 
this has been upheld as outstanding works had not been done. Schedule of works to be done has been agreed with the tenant and she is happy with outcome. Dec vouchers were also issued.
This is a complex hoarding case where we've maintained contact with the customer over a sustained period of time to identify and monitor the required improvements in terms of decluttering.  It appears there are a r ange of contact with this customer that has been followed up via the Housing Officer in partnership with Property Care.  A clear lesson her is around the clarity of follow-up from Property Care in writing concerning numerous repairs issues in a timely way.
This is difficult due to the barriers in place with communicating with this tenant.  I have partially upheld due to us being able to take the measures we did with no prior notice so we were not wrong - but by taking into account the feelings this generated maybe we need to review the methods of comms with this for a rent point of view.
This is more a complaint regarding the tenant in no. 10 above. I have raised on CRM for a housing officer to attend the flat above and explain the impact on the tenant below. 
This is not the level of high service we expect especially from a gch engineer covering out of hours calls. The engineer has been made aware of his actions. 
This lady wants to put a formal complaint in as she waited in all morning for Slatters to arrive and they did not turn up despite her getting a text message.(job 777102). She called here at 12.30pm and I was able to tell her it was booked until1pm.She later called back as no one had been at 1.14pm and I called Slatters to be told it was booked as an afternoon appointment. Mrs Ransom was not happy as she had missed a monthly meeting whilst waiting for this appointment and said it was not a good enough service.
"This property has historically been difficult to access. I think we need to look into the history of no accesses and escalate to the Neighbourhood Management team is there are repeated no accesses, especially for compliance issues and reported leaks etc."
"This type of property with staircases with three exposed walls leading directly in to a maisonette will always be very difficult to maintan a sutable environment to prevent mould growth. It is very difficult to maintain adequate heat, whilst ventilating adequately to prevent moisture build up leading to large cold areas where insulation is very poor and the build up of surface moisture and then mould growth. Subject to the survey results suitable actions/recommendations can then be followed. As there is no record of the issue of mould/damp being recorded previously it is difficult to say what lessons can be learned. However checks are to be made that accurate records of  faults/issues being received by GCH are recorded appropriately and in enough detail for the correct actions and persons engaged to resolve the situation as  quicky and easily  from the tenants perspective as possible."
This was  caused by a previous contractor not returning to site to honour defect commitments.  In future we need to be quicker to appoint alternative contractors and recharge to the contractor who completed work
This was difficult as we would normally be able to discuss on the telephone our intentions but as Mr Lloyd is hard of hearing this had to be done in a letter which he felt was the wrong tone. The review of the letters showed this was not the case but I will reiterate to the team we need to try and make all correspondence as personal as possible going forward as our intention could be misinterpreted. Where we are sending out correspondence that we have not written ourselves such as a NTQ we must ensure that we are enclosing correspondence from us to show why this is being said this way.
"This was not actually a complaint but due to the service area manager being off it was passed on. There had been a letter sent to residents about the ILO changes and in the letter it specified if you had a concern then contact Becky Evans - she is out of the office so it has been dealt with but there was nothing to uphold, no actual complaint just feedback on a process. Response letter sent thanking tenant.  I have also given her the opportunity to make further contact with Becky Evans going forward if she had concerns to raise. "
"Thoroughly investigated communications regarding both the door and the legal pack. Solicitors payment for the pack was not referenced and thus not identified until they chased the pack (28/7). It was then sent out on 5/8 which is deemed a reasonable timescale and this section of the complaint is not upheld. 
Regarding the door: initial quote Apr 20 £738; Oct 20 revised quote £954 from Nationwide (material cost increase due to Covid and material shortage due to Brexit); one-off installations were put on hold by Nationwide. GCH has now commissioned a new contractor and a letter has been sent to all LH offering options - response needed by 30/8/21. Communications re. the changes could have been more formal and an apology for that has been given."
Time can help in solving intermittent faults. Keeping the level of communication up will help with resolving faults.
Timely actions required as original survey for damp and mould was carried out in March 2022. Assests did not action based on report findings as far as I can tell until at least August 2022 when chased by Tenant
"Timescales of what was involved were accurate and not a fault with GCH.  Customer made clear during the call and by discussing my findings that the wording of the final email from the LH Manager was frustrating.  When I explained the situation and added that it would have been a reasonable assusmption that the water was coming from their property, they agreed but stated that is what should have been said.  Response emailed as no formal address to return to."
"Timings on jobs need to be accurate so we don’t do half the job, engineers need to close jobs down correctly so we don’t assume the job is complete. The turn around on reports being sent in and actioned needs to be quicker. "
Tnt not happy with the service and the outcomes of his ASB complaint. Email on file
To act within a satisfactory timescale to address all residents needs. Procedure (to get damp survey done where necessary) to be reviewed to allow quicker resolutions.
To add a note to Orchard advising staff to ring the communal buzzer before any visit. This has been done by Cex.

To ensure that a clear timeline is in place for major adaptation works like this.
"To ensure that attempts are made to contact customers via all methods. If no response to a telephone call then text, email and letter / door knock should be explored. This will be fedback to the team during the next round of team meetings."
To ensure that communication to vulnerable client groups is sent clearly and if needed to alternative receivers where necessary. To make sure that all GCH staff are aware of procedural changes with regards to Lifelink charges.
To ensure that the Customer feels valued and listened to.
"To ensure that the GCH 'Tone of Voice' ethos does not just apply to telephone conversations or face to face meetings. A customer can become equally frustrated by written communications such as emails, letters, Noise App communications etc.                                                            
Joanne was spoken to on 15th July about this complaint and an ASB case opened on 16th July and a warning letter sent to the neighbour.                                                                  "
"To ensure that when an initial customer enquiry is made that a full investigating is taken place to consider long term solutions, which on this occasion could have avoided a formal complaint. "
To ensure that where a job has been raised to then then ensure that it has been resolved. 
"To ensure that where multiple or duplicate notices are received theyare married up together and that the agreed tenancy termination date, corresponds to the initial letter received, rather that protracting the notice period (which had been the intended consequence on this occasion)."
"To ensure the viewing on a new build scheme takes place in the fortnight before handover and ideally not on the Friday, followed by the tenancy sign up on a Monday"
"To fix the problems reported/discussed the following proposals have been made,  the following works and remedial actions will be taken:

•	Job to be raised for a plumber to attend to rectify leak to stopcock under sink.
•	Job to be raised to carry out wash down of mouldy areas behind sink base and apply anti mould solution to affected areas. 
•	Job to be raised to overhaul kitchen and replace damaged doors/drawers as required. (Every effort will be made to match your existing door & drawer fronts, however where this is not possible a close a match as possible will be sought but this is not always possible.)

In-addition you also stated that your W/M & D/W were not draining and that your front door was draughty.
•	Job to be raised to check sink waste and associated pipework for blockages as W/M & D/W are having issues draining
•	Job to be raised to look at front door adjustment to ensure it sits against bottom seal/draught excluder

As a gesture of good will, I will also instruct the installation of two additional wall units to be fitted, if possible, one to the R/H side of the cooker and one to the L/H side of the kitchen door next to the fridge. "
To follow up on assigned CRM cases where actions are required. This appears to have been lost due to this being a patch share.
"to get the outstanding works done and offer of £10 compensation to re-imburse for purchase of lamp, lamp was not required, also send slatter electrical out to show the customer how to use the panel heater in the bathroom."
To have arranged for an initial visit for inspection purposes sooner with the initial incident having been reported through our of hours. This would have improved the customer experience on this occasion
"To perhaps consult with residents re any new parking arrangements before implementation. This will be done at the monthly resident's meeting, if appropriate."
To reassign CRM cases when there is long term absences within the team. 
To understand across GCH that these residents are vulnerable and may need a full breakdown of their current charges explained to them.
"to update tenants on a regular basis, even if there is no update. "
Toilet blockage now resolved with further works booked for 5/11/21.
"Tool box talk taking place to remind engineers of phone policy, body language & customer service requirements.  Schedulers need to review jobs in more detail to understand the bigger picture of the customers journey"
"Toolbox talk for 'looking into windows' or potential thereof to be undertaken. IL/JP to action going forward, already actioned with Lovell for this phase of works."
Toolbox talk to take place in terms of replacing CO2 detectors when sensor expires however most units now do not have a separate sensor expiry date.  
Training /Advice given to staff ensuring that the need for clear communication with customers and the adherence to repair time scales is implemented.
Training around making more enquires when speaking with customers.
"training for LC, case closing contact for LC, update procedure - for full details please see my investigation notes in the complaint file."
training for new staff member on standard letters. Also we had a system error which led to wrong info to officer so procedure updated in IT re moving of properties into new PG.
"Training needed on providing factual information in a more empathetic manner, being aware of how the person could be feeling and maybe trying other methods of contact. Also, up to date info needs to be put on GCH website about power of attorney, giving notice and requesting monies and what we require. "
Training needed to recognise a complaint or a request for service.
"Training to be done, by more listening to calls, how to react to situations."
treatment to treat the bugs has been arranged - this was as a result of her having made two calls to customer service and her being told that we cannot help her - we could have had this put through to Voids team to address and avoided this complaint - this is not a TS complaint it is a voids complaint although i have dealt with it and responded - i have reclassified as this is not anything to do with TS or Lettings - further feedback - pest control have confirmed that the bugs were taken inot the property through a divan bed which was taken in by the customer 23/2/2023
Two aspects to this complaint - the use of Tort Notices on vehicles and staff attitude. Investigation into the original telephone conversation with a member of staff led to the complaint being partially upheld.  During various telephone conversations with the tenant as part of the investigation the purpose of the Tort notice was explained and an action plan was agreed in terms of collection of the scrapped vehicle and proposed timescales for making the remaining vehicles roadworthy;
Two incidents in quick succession.  Temp fix was only completed on the first pending a new door install.  Second incident occured prior to new door install so customer shoud not incur the cost as the door would have already been claimed for by GCH insurance.  Recharge removed from account.
"Txt messaging is causing confusion, more checks to be made when appointments are re booked."
Txt messaging of appointments is causing some confusion with customers when appointments are moved or cancelled and a resolution will need to be found.
Unable to agree to suggestions of installing a communal letterbox but agreed to addres the issue with the rear communal door being propped open by Residents. This has now been done by the NM.
Unable to assess where this could have been improved on
Unable to discuss previous issues re. fencing as employee no longer with GCH
Unable to speak directly with the customer on this occasion as no phone details on our system and the complaint received in writing. On reviewing all the contact we've had with Mr Hooper before he moved into the Retreat and subsequently there is no evidence of any enquiries regarding the right to buy. Details on the GCH website and within the EAT Tenancy Agreement set out that some properties are exceptions from the Right to Buy. This includes the Retreat and all properties within the GCH Independent Living Service in line with statutory restrictions and guidance on Right to Buy. I've offered Mr Hooper the opportunity to discuss this through in further detail (in person or over the phone) if additional clarification is required over and above the explanation provided in the complaint correspondence.
"Unable to speak to Mr England- s/w Simon at Novus- door delayed by 1 week, Mrs Murray declined first install date as Mr M in hospital, at Mrs Murray's request, install booked for 9th Jan which has been done."
Unable to speak to tenant to discuss the compalint and the details
Unable to speak with mr Thomas but letter sent in first class post today advising i had interviewed Iona and given details within the letter still offering support and advice and clarifying all repairs have been ordered 
"Unfortuately thes soil stacks to these and other blocks of flats are subject to scaling and from time to time they need to be cleared/descaled, however these times are not predicatable and often lead to flooding issues. "
"Unfortunately in circumstances like this the diagnosis of the route cause of th eproble can be conviluted and time consuming, often with one issue masking another. This has also not been helped on this occasion due to th eage of th eexisiting services with multiple failures in multiple properties coninciding at the same time. "
"Unfortunately we cannot stock every part for every boiler on our vans. The part took within 7 days to come from the supplier, we fittted in less than this. Boiler is now working. Temporary heaters were provided in the meantime and £2 per heater per day will be reimbursed in accordance with policy."
"Unfortunately, Ms Elder was not able to make a scheduled appointment on the 14 July due to COVID infection. No further appointments were able to be made and I am waiting on Ms Elder to contact me to discuss further. I have therefore closed the complaint. "
Until the results of the damp survey have been assessed it is difficult to make further recommendations based on limited information at this time. A further review of the situation will be required once th e recommendations of the independant survey have been made.
Updated customer on progress via voicemail.  As a courtesy we will Zero the dept and have provided the instructions.  Awaiting confirmation of parts from Glevum/Manufacturer.
Updated resident on where they are in the DFG process. Also agreed to put a fact sheet together to help residents and staff understand the time it takes for a grant to approved with the council
Upheld - information was given in error and Homeseeker have been contacted and the reference withdrawn and an updated reference submitted.  The reference to a report of cannabis use in 2012 has been removed from his record. Not upheld - that KB & PR were malicious. KB provided the information in error and PR had no involvement in the reference request at all. Also the recharge details were provided to the tenant.
"Upon speaking to tenant, he wanted to meet in person at RWH.  This has been booked for 16th February as the 1st available opportunity for us both to be able to meet.  16th Feb - met with tenant - following our discussion he has indicated that he wishes to withdraw his complaint however there is some follow-up work based on the issues he raised and resolutions which I am currently working on and am in contact with Mr Grimes about, which will include an inspection at his property.  Complaint withdrawn - email confirming sent to Mr G and uploaded to spreadsheet."
Urgent inspection undertaken and subsequent works passed to contractor who are to advise tenant of date for works.
Various factors and teams are involved in this complaint. ASSESTS/OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS -With regard to the lack of response from the OT on the kitchen this has left Miss Leach struggling to cope with her deteriorating health conditions. Initial case states that the OT will be given a priority of 8/12 weeks response but this was not adhered too on this occasion. When checking CRM no further updates have been added since the intitial response. Regular reviews of outstanding OT requiremnts should actioned to ensure requests are followed up in a timely manner or at least flagged if the resource and priorities do not allow a timely response and tenants should be updated and response recorded against case on CRM. REPAIRS/HOUSINGS Learnings: Following a major flood or incident the tenant should be visited by the most suiable person to assess ongoing issues/responses required for a minimum period. (Suggest four weeks!)
VB2 needs to be in place due to residents allegations.
"Verbally agred extention of time with Ms Joyner at first appointment on 13 May, initially for 10 additional days and then in subsequant calls requested to extend until  Friday 27 May. All works as recommended in damp survey now to be carried out as previously agreed. All booked for 17 June and agreed with Ms Joyner. "
"Verbally agreed extention of time at visit to property with Mrs Young on the 09 May,  based on requirements of investigation. Confirmed as of 30 May that would respond in writting 31/05-22Due to legacy issue with roof renewal, no simple solution is available to resolve the damp and mould issues in the various room locations at high level in this property, as either no insulation has been applied at the time of roof installation or limited insulation, an independant damp survey will be instructed with recommmendations of this taken to relevant parties for resolution. Once understood the issue needs to be looked at as a potential defect from the roof renewals that took place to this property pre-2021. As the whole street had the roofs renewed, it is my recommendation that the original specification be revisited and assessed to ensure the works were carried out propererly and if not,  that the contractor is bought to task or if poorly designed or not specified properly then a wider site wide solution is sought.  The problems with poor insulation are emphasised at No 12B as this is the first floor masionette on the end of a terrace.  As a interim measure a job will be raised to wash down and treat affected areas of mould. Whilst further discussions are held and investigations carried out."
"Verbally agreed extention of time on 31/06/2022  to allow for investigation following inspection/survey on 21/06/2022 - Resolution: Agrred to have independant damp survey carried out and act on recommendations or pass to other department to organise, Fill and bring back to finish ready fo rdecoration in various areas, rehang door and repair frame to lounge/hall door, Rehang door/repair frame  to kitchen/hall door, Repair lounge L/H opening  casement hinge  to allow to be fully opened and egress functionallity and fix leaks to bathroom basin taps. Compensation offered of £280 for ongoing inconvienience, issues since 2015 when originally reported the damp/mould issues. "
Very difficult to put addtional learnings due to the complexities of locating the root cause.  It was clear the customer was looking for a move which is what we agreed if the problem is not fixed. 
Very limited due to contractor no longer in business.  Only partially upheld due to this issue.
Very poor description of works from engineer and delays with CRM case being passed. To work with PC to improve works descriptions and with scheduling to improve speedy of CRM cases
"Visit to tenant 15 May, Photos taken of damaged tv. Incident discussed with Slatters who agreed to replace TV. Model agreed with tenant and delivery date agreed with tenant as 21/5/20 (tenant made aware it has to be left 2m from the door when delivered). Delivery confirmed/accepted by tenant."
"Visited customer twice, customer has installed new partition wall (ex partner) 3 years ago, without seeking consent for any alterations. Had this been sought, an asbestos survey would have been provided to the customer. Had not sought consent despite knowing abouit our alterations policy as had previously had consent to replace front door.  Cracks are above the newly installed partition wall. Liability not GCH's. Additionally, noted damp on chimney breast and chimney needs repointing. Also raise a job for JP to replace shed roof but customer need to remove ivy. Customer also referred to OT for housing needs assessment and referal to enhanced support coaches for benefit check."
Visited Mrs Letts with IL Team Leader to discuss all concerns raised. Some were justified and will address these with the Scheme Manager. Some were down to being unaware of service procedures which have nw been explained.
"Visited property on 24/06/2022. Resident confirmed no longer any issues with the boiler. This has been resolved. Evidence of damp/mould throughout the property. Area worst effected is the bathroom, extractor fan is not in very good condition. Resident appears to keep the property well ventilated. Multiple issues in various rooms and therefor agreed to appoint independant damp surveyor to inspect and advise. GCH to action his suggestions.     See email no file. No access or response from resident for damp survey. Not upheld as no access gained for damp survey. "
"Visited property on the 27/06/2022. Agreed  to send engineer to bond the hole, artex the ceiling and paint the wall. Advised the engineer will also check the kitchen sink unit and feedback what remedial work is required to rectify the damage from a water leak. "
Visited tenant inspect and perform epc. Have spoken to steve L who advised need to send experience plumber to diagnose fault or report back on escalation works. This has been sent to scheduling. Also raised a job to have the vents removed and blocked within property as well as fans upgraded. 2x holes also raised to be filled within the roof of the bedroom. roof is being replaced so insulation will be topped up. also spoke with garf who has put the boiler and rads on programme for upgrade. 
"Visited tenants house, they understood no damage has been caused by the leak and the reasons for the appointment being cancelled. "
"Voicemail left 21/9 and 22/9 (MD) but calls not returned. Tenant complained about the time taken to fix the boiler and the leaks that followed. Agreed to install the part required tomorrow afternoon, and replace damaged kitchen units.  "
Void promises to be reviewed and audited to ensure completion.
Void standard must be met  completely before a property is signed over to Housing.
Void standard wasn't great and further works could have been done to make for a better experience. OT referral should have been identified earlier from what customer has said in emails and visits.
Wall to be removed - works completed 09/08/2022
Water supply has been turned on and tenant is happy. She just wanted to be sure her disabilities were recorded on the system so if this issue occurs again it will be handled correctly. 
"We agreed that cause was a communication issue and not hearing the customers ""voice"" which delayed the relevant actions being taken.  A review has already taken place in terms of communication and quality of workmanship which has been addressed with individuals concerned."
"We agreed to assist with the removal of waste from the loft that you no longer required
£75 goodwill for the delays and poor service."
We are already looking to reduce the letters sent to tenants and for more personal interaction to take place - this reinforces that opinion
We are awaiting photos of the tiles and confirmation where these were purchased. We will then be able to replace like for like. Tenant happy with this.
We are changing contractors which will help massively in this situation but no set learning outcomes.
We are experiencing multiple issues with works assigned to MBM. This is being reviewed currently. However GCH can be more proactive in chasing contractors when work has been assigned as this is sent to them and then forgotten about so we could do with chasing them more regularly. 
We are not able to repair the issue as this is being demolished but we are working to move all the affected tenants as soon as possible. No failings from a repairs perspective. 
We are now replacing the door entry system so tenant was happy with this. Advised I will keep an eye on this for him.
"We are writing today to complain in the strongest possible terms about the condition of the property which has been recently rented to us by yourselves. The property in question was supposed to be handed over to us in a habitable condition but unfortunately nothing could have been further from the truth. An inspection was done by yourselves prior to the exchange taking place , the inspection was passed off on the understanding that the previous tenants undertook to thoroughly clean the property, this never happened and every single room had to be deep cleaned and bleached before we could even move our contents into them and that even included the floor boards. Our housing officer and the inspector admitted that they could not carry out the inspection properly because of the amount of stuff in the house but it was passed off anyway.ince moving in we have had to thoroughly clean every surface in the house including walls, floors and ceilings. The condition was so bad that we have had to temporarily decorate all the rooms in the house just to make the property liveable, this has included painting walls and woodwork.
A re inspection has been done recently and most of the outstanding work it has been agreed will be repaired by yourselves but there are still some things that you haven’t agreed to do, 1: major crack in the kitchen ceiling, we were told this was probably from when the bathroom was installed and it was normal, we disagree with this and consider a crack of this size to be a health hazard: 2: major crack in the ceiling at the top of the stairs, we were told this probably happened when the roof insulation was put in, that may be the case but it is still your responsibility to sort this out. 3: although the window sills are down to be repaired/replaced some of the windows themselves are letting in large amounts of draught. Since moving into this property we have had to spend a large sum of money on cleaning products, decorating products , and our dad has had to take a lot of time off work to come and help us make the house liveable in, and now we are having to pay more for our energy bills because of the ill fitting windows. 
"
"We could have got Kate Harrison involved much earlier in the process, had we have done this we would have resolved the access issues sooner and the process would have been smoother for the tenant. "
"We had no evidence of him cancelling his insurance two months prior but tenants insurance is automatically renewed at the start of  each financial year, therefore we felt it was appropriate to cancel his insurance without charge given that it was within a reasonable time period from us notifying him being charged for the new financial year."
We have agreed to include an additional letter in the adaptation process and completed a review meeting with the team involved 
We have agreed to replace some of the flowers as a gesture of goodwill.
We have an appointment to replace the part and we are switching contractors which will make getting parts much easier.
"We have arranged an appointment on 21st October for myself, Dave Barnes and Dan Hodgson to complete the outstanding works and inspect the kitchen as she has raised concerns with this. An appt has also been arranged for 25th October to replace the stop tap. I have offered £150 goodwill gesture. "
"We have arranged for the guttering works to be completed and following this, the bathroom and flooring works will be completed. "
We have arranged for the whole system to be replaced on the 15th and 16th of March. Tenant was happy with this.
We have attended and inspected and repaired all radiators within 4 hours on both occassions. New radiator is being ordered and I will monitor to ensure this is arranged. No service failings from GCH. 
"We have been inconsistent by erecting a fence (even though the residents are happy we have created a new issue). Adaptations on estates should be spoken about across GCH to identify any issues this may cause especially if, as here, it is a mixed tenure block with tenants and leaseholders. "
We have booked an appointment to fit a new pair of taps within 5 days. Resident is happy that GCH will deal with the engineer in question. 
We have fixed the bathroom light but could not get hold of tenant for further information.
We have no turnaround times with Intergas - this means that we have no say as to when appts go ahead for our tenants. We need to arrange a meeting with them to build a relationship and manage the contract. We need to put deadlines and timeframes in place to ensure we are able to confirm these with tenants. 
We have now requested to see all post inspection notes for Glevum installations to ensure that 100 % post inspection is carried our on sub contracted work 
"We have offered £25 for the  missed appointment, confirmed that an appointment has been arranged for 6th October and she is happy with this. Confirmed that training and feedback is being provided to ensure this does not happen again."
"We have offered 2 options to the tenant. 1. We can offer £500 as a gesture of goodwill for the poor service you have received from GCH, and you claim on your insurance policy for the damage to the property. 2.You seek legal action against GCH for the damages incurred."
We have picked up the issue of addresses not being full on CRM - we have messaged out to all of our temas advising to gain the informtaion directly from Orchard as CRm does not seem correct all of the time we have also flagged this to Micheal H and Rob P 
We have raised an inspection and any works that need to be completed will be arranged. I requested the income manager contacts her to discuss rent arrears and the NM calls her to discuss ongoing issues around neighbours and comms. 
We have raised an inspection to look into the condensation and apologised for any miscommunication on our end.
We have reviewed the adaptation process as a team and agreed an additional letter to improve communication with residents.  The staff involved have also been reminded of their responsibility to communicate well with residents. 
"We have tried to rectify the issues in the property, but the block itself is not up to today standards. Regeneration plan in Podsmead is already in place and this block has been identified to be replaced as part of the plan. Will set a reminder in my diary to follow up on the mould issues for every 3 months to proactively tackle any further problems."
we have visited 14 times in last 18 months for the blockage to the sink. something should have been picked up and escalated sooner to either advise whether tenants responsibility or ours. 
We need a policy that we can look to in a bid to take effective action backed up by a published set of reasons why we do this - policy being drafted now by Head of Housing to go to Tenant panel in November. 
We need to be attending appointments within timescale - especially if emergency (4 hours). If anything unforeseen then the tenant should be called to advise. 
"We need to be checking in orchard how many times we have been out to wash down mould. 5x in 2 years shows there is something that isnt right, whether preventable by tenant or us. Should have been escalated sooner. Potential training on CX going forward on the process. Operatives who visit tenants need to be managed on what they disclose with the tenants. An operative told our tenant even when you clean the mould it will still remain airbourne, tenant has COPD, which panicked them further unecessarily as it is balance of probabilities, the likely hood is slim of getting adverse effects from the amount in property. Issue with the sink was ongoing from before september and the email trail extensive. Just needed a visit from a supervisor and a final decision to be made."
We need to be clear with contractors about timeframe when allocating work which falls outside of their day-to-day operations
We need to be clear with residents about potential delays caused by asbestos and ensure that our TLO s are engaging earlier to set the expectations accurately. 
We need to be making sure that all outstanding works are completed and followed up. These repairs had been raised several times with no actions from the GCH.
"We need to be making sure that when jobs are raised, we ask if there are disabilities at the property. This will make sure that anything that has not been correctly recorded can be flagged."
"We need to be more reactive and have a desire to find the leak first time. We attended previously and couldnt find a leak despite water dripping, the leak was behind a vanity unit"
We need to ensure that if we experience a no access that we attempt a call a further time. I think especially for tenants with severe disabilities we need to make sure we attempt further contact. Perhaps every week we gather all the no accesses for that week and possibly send a text to each tenant to advise there was a no access and to give us a call? 
We need to ensure that we abide by timescales set out within our service level agreements whereby GCH and its contractors communicate effectively and promptly to obtain quotes and appointment dates for this type of work. I have also raised a meeting internally to discuss the approval process following a quote being received to ensure this is a swift and clear process which will again reduce the chances of this situation from happening again resulting in repairs being carried out sooner. 
"We need to ensure that we act upon emails within 24 hours to ensure they are not forgotten about. Emails should always be sent to a generic email inbox or CC'd in to ensure that emails are not missed.

When jobs are being raised, these need to be specific on the right location as we were going back and forth to this property with the incorrect information which led to a huge delay."
We need to ensure that we are arranging the correct works to ensure we do not attend for the wrong job.
we need to ensure that we offer realistic adaptation time frames to residents at void stage 
We need to ensure that works are carried out to a good standard in the first instance to ensure repeat issues don't occur. A reminder to Engineers on quality of work.
We need to ensure we all have a better understanding of boundary fences and responsibilities as we provided inaccurate information.  Training around fencing and boundrays of GCH and Private properties needs to be completed to ensure correct advice is given at all times.
We need to implement a smoother process for when engineers take leave last minute. I am going to speak with Natalie and learn the current process and find an improvement.
We need to improve the communication around adaptations.  We have agreed to hold a meeting every other week to discuss progress of jobs and also to being sending a letter after each OT assessment confirming that works have been passed to the relevant contractor
We need to improve the communication between Asset Management and Tenancy Services when discussing installation of pods. 
We need to listen to customers concerns and carry out repairs/make safe and arrange any follow on work required. Engineer concerned has been spoken with.
We need to manage tenants expectations better and operatives need be sending reports to us in a timely manner.
We need to remind all engineers to remain professional and friendly with every visit. 
We need to review our process when properties and garages are being demolished. We refused repairs to the garage as it was being demolished which led to the roof collapse. We need to review the repairs process for these situations. 
We need to review the void process for properties where bed bugs are known and these need to be reported. We did know about this issue during void stage but it was not properly treated.
We need to revisit our training on Customer service/Telephone conversations and how to deal with difficult conversations. This should in turn help us to avoid these types of complaints. (LD emailed VR cc MD 10/8 re. discussing appropriate training post MD leave. Chased VR 4/9/20)
"We should be asking for the tenants preference for communication and ensuring that we use this to converse with people. We should also ensure every interaction with a customer is noted, recorded and the accurate and adequate notes are put onto the Orchard system for review.  There are two rent duty officers daily so these should be utilised by CST."
"We will be ensuring going forward that while we always open up a case with an action plan for the primary complainant and also confirm the closure of the case, that we consistently afford any additional complainants with the same level of communication.  We will learn from the feedback to strengthen our case management approach going forward"
We will be looking to either repair or replace based on what the manufacturer finds.
We will review defect process to ensure we have open lines of communuication.
When a complaint of this nature comes in from a customer there needs to be improved communication between departments in order that Property Care can consider an inspection and/or treatment works and the Housing teams can effectively support the customer. CRM offers the opportunity as Property Care come on line during phase 2.
"When a customer has multiple complaints running at the same time, a coordinated case management approach should be implemented.  We are also aware that because the customer was unable to engage as part of the investigation that we have not been able to fully hear their feedback or sense check the response and proposals with him.  "
"When a customer is looking to move for medical reasons, it is worth checking to see if there is anything we can do in their current property to assist whilst they are waiting to move, as it is usual that a move will take some time. This is to be discussed at the next Team Meeting."
"When a property is in void stage, we need to be checking the garden and fencing as this would have been avoided."
When customers make GCH colleagues aware of their preferences this is recorded on the relevant systems. There is no poor service as the NM (Shazia) was not aware that the customer wanted the buzzer to be used before any visit (Cex have now placed a marker on Orchard in light of this). The customer was initially unhappy that Shazia could not make a return visit the same day but I have looked at Shazia's calendar and there was no capacity for her to accommodate this.
"When issues need to be investigated, operatives need to be thorough in carrying out their initial investigations. Quality Control measures are to be put in place to address this. The details of how this is to be carried out will be discussed at the next scheduled Supervisors Team Meeting.(Scheduled 20/01/22)"
"When visited the tenant - i carried out an epc, inspection around their property of all the putstanding issues along with checking the age/condition of bathroom. Explained to tenant about the priority works needed rewire and heating upgrade. Swindon Law centre have taken on a claim as the tenant has said she has been without a boiler for over 5 years. The tenant said she did not want any works being done other than the minor repairs in the winter and wants the heating upgrade etc to be in the summer months. I agreed we would hold the works off until May which the tenant was happy with. I called the tenant up again as MD needed to do a pre-inspection and unfortunately tenant reverted back to how they were before - and would not communicate with me. I have passed this to Rob Panou and housing to negotiate with tenant. All the repairs and structural issues on the property have been reported to relevant departments in the mean time. Resolution letter has been sent. "
"When visiting Mr & Mrs Hahn and discussing their request for resolution to the complaint, they made it clear that they just wanted to feel listened to and treated fairly. I apologied on behalf of GCH that they felt that this had not happened previously, although the NM in question was no longer employed by the company."
When visiting the customer they agreed an extension for final resolution during visit on 16/01/2020.  Message left for customer to advise we have sourced an independent company to complete an in depth survey & they will be contacting her shortly to make an appointment.  30/01/20 - Appointment has been confirmed with customer for 06/02/2020. 26/02/2020 - All works have been authorised by the surveyor.  Decent homes standards were met & customer was happy with the outcome.
"When we attempt to locate the root cause of a damp and mould issue and our resolution hasnt fix it,  we need to react and return to site asap to investigate instead of letting it continue"
"When we attempt to locate the root cause of a damp and mould issue and our resolution hasnt fix it,  we need to react and return to site asap to investigate instead of letting it continue"
When we carry out an inspection we need to receive the report asap and react to it. This was a case where we inspected the proerty but the report went missing 
When works orders are delayed because of an issue with GCH resources the  booking of said appointment should be a priority
Whilst dealing with this case it has become apparent when there are other issues affecting the customer that it is useful to see if the customer is happy for you to talk to there support worker as they can sometimes explain the issues better to both us and the customer.
Whilst I feel the telephone voice mail was satisfactory the only aspect which could have been considered was for Property Care to have made Debbie aware that the customer had been out of the country in America towards mid/end of March 2019. Reasonable access hadn't been provided on 11/04/19 when the issue was referred from Property Care to Tenancy Services
Whilst it was apparent that Deborah Preece had contacted the complaiant by phone  several months ago there had not been a response to the email. Communication is of paramount importance and heightens the sense of being listened to and being able to convey that we're engaging with customers to address reported housing management issues
"Whilst the enforcement action that refers to a neighbouring property at 12 Darwin Road is underway in accordance with established practice and legal considerations, the one aspect which could have been managed more effectively was providing Mr Jones with an update that the review of his VB2 marker was part of a comprehensive review for all alerts involving feedback from customer facing managers and housing teams. Whilst this reasonably impacted on the completion and the requirement for a revised timeline, this should have been communicated to Mr Jones as a courtesy.  "
"Whilst the underlying principles and process of the Mutual Exchange were adhered to this complaint perhaps highlights that on occasions customers state they accept as seen, whilst not necessarily recognising that there may be decoration works, cleaning etc. to complete once they've moved in following a mutual exchange. The learning from this case is that when a customer visits a property and accepts the condition (albeit with household effects in place) that a follow up viewing could be arranged with all parties including the Housing Officer if the property is cluttered,  to clarify that the assigner and assignee are completely satisfied with the mutual exchange going ahead. This would strengthen the customers’ expectations alongside the statutory considerations and guidance within GCH's Mutual Exchange Policy, which has recently been reviewed and approved with Tenant Panel. If there are any lingering doubts customers should be encouraged to take stock and review the position. For GCH staff if there are any issues of obvious repair & maintenance issues visible at the inspection stage a further inspection should be co-ordinated with a Surveyor and if there remains concerns the Mutual Exchange should be deferred until the matters have been satisfactorily addressed (even if the customer states they wish to undertake the minor repairs once they've moved in). JH "
"Whilst there are no lessons learnt as such from this case, it has highlighted that where family members are involved and they make specific enquiries, that it's reasonable for GCH as a landlord to highlight that authority/consent is required from our customer to disclose and share information. John Ingles (Tenancy Services Team Leader) has contacted the family members on two occasions to maintain a dialogue leaving messages with Mrs Midwinter's husband"
"Whilst there is clear evidence that GCH has acted in a responsible manner and progressed 'no access' case management methodically, there was perhaps an opportunity to have provided Mr Shaw with an informal general update (mindful of GDPR imperatives). "
Wider review requested on heating system
"Will arrange a visit next week to see if there is anything that can be done to assure the customer that the windows are safe (these were replaced in 2020). The flue issue has been already resolved but have been assured by the Dan Sadler that if there had been any leak of harmful gases the carbon monoxide alarm would have alerted the customer. We wil continue to deal with any blockages and have asked that the customer makes us aware of any issues so we can resolve. Support has again been offered with various issues which the neighbourhood team have previously been supporting Miss thomas with, have reiterated that we will continue to support. There have been problems with access and lack of communication previously which have not helped either party with dealing with these issues. Have offered to pay the debt on the meter as an act of good will to ensure the customer has a working heating system which can be serviced."
"will update this after receiving report as that may  gives us lessons learnt,"
"Window issue to be resolved 6/12/21 am (delay due to second person being needed to remove window so the repair can be a permanent fix), Temporary fan heater given to customer until storage heaters can be fitted by Slatters (date TBC) to see the customer through until gas heating is installed early 2022 (through planned works). Customer also given advice on HomeSeekers and advised GCH can help ensure details are correct and up to date. Have also informed customer of phone numer and email address of Tenancy Sustainment. Customer happy with what had been agreed and has thanked GCH for dealing with the issues. The complaint was, however,only partially upheld - the period with no heating (and thus the impact) would have been much reduced had it not been for numerous ""no access"" visits."
With lack of information and evidence to back customers claims I could not uphold her complaint. However this was revisited by Income when FT contacted us again and an agreement has been reached whereby we will write off half the current arrrears once she has paid off the other half.
With the new Repairs Supervisors and Repairs Manager in place we will be better equipped to ensure repairs are kept on top of and dealt with in a timely manner.  A better technical diagnosis of the problem would help with first time fixes with more time for Supervisors to check on quality and standards of work both from internal resources and contractors .
With the new Repairs Supervisors and Repairs Manager in place we will be better equipped to ensure repairs are kept on top of and dealt with in a timely manner. A better technical diagnosis of the problem would have resolved the issue and potentially saved on repeat visits.
"With the new Repairs Supervisors and Repairs Manager in place we will be better equipped to ensure repairs are kept on top of and dealt with in a timely manner. In this case, although chased by the Repairs team, a supervisor/manager decision was never made to go ahead with the works. Email has been sent to Repairs Manager and Supervisors to highlight these issues and help ensure the situation is not repeated."
Withdrew the charge for rechargable repairs
Wooden structure agreed to be removed and investigate further solutions for recycling
Word of advise given to surveyors when attending the Lampreys (to park away from Josephs flat and avoid taking calls or meetings in the vicinity). Email sent to NM and Paul Reilly.
Worked with ASB and Asset Mgt to understand background. Contractors work between 8am-5pm. Residents are given prior notice of any works which will directly affect/inconvenience them and of any works to be outside 8-5. The times of the ASB noise fall outside of 8-5 and related to verbal exchanges/ incidents rather than noise associated with repairs or maintenance. Also ASB reports related mainly to the period before the current works. This was all advised to the tenant.
Works booked for completion by 1/12/21: kitchen units to be removed and holes filled to prevent rodent access;  kitchen ceiling damage from previous leak to be repaired; landing floorboard to be re-fixed. Future works (when door available so c12 weeks) - new front door to be supplied and fitted. £350 compensation and £50 goodwill offered. NB - MBM surveyed 25/11 and repairs subsequently booked in by them for 9/12/21.
Works booked in with NKS to start 30th May
"Works commencement date agreed, £250 compensation"
"Works completed , Compensation made for additional heating costs along with a time and trouble payment."
Works had not been completed as agreed with customer. This has resulted in damaged being caused to the property due to lack of proper ventilation in the kitchen.
works have been identified that need doing (please see complaint response). These cannot be carried out until the property is cleared. With the tenants permission I have asked neighbourhood team to make contact (crm case pictured in complaint respone folder). Once the propertry is clear we can raise the works required. Complaint not upheld as the issues were never raised with us and when we were made aware we have acted  to rectify.
Works have not be raised following previous inspections and when leaks from the flat above have happended in the past the leaks have been rectified but the follow up works to the damaged caused in the property has not be raised.
"Works now in hand - booked in through Lovell by Iona Lennon. (Asbestos cement tiles to be removed 26/11 which will then allow the roofing (batten and refelting works) to be completed. Tiling work will be carried out on 29/11 along with lead flashings to complete the work. All work is weather dependant.
Works were originally contracted 4/10 but permission for access to two adjacent gardens (to erect scaffolding) had to be obtained and the required asbestos survey was delayed until 20/10, with the report not received until 4/11, owing to third party workload/staffing issues. The survey found asbestos in the roof tiles and the asbestos removal company were fully booked until 26/11. These delays compounded previous poor service which led to this complaint - the customers request for compensation is justified. I discussed with RP and IL and max offer of £1000 has been agreed as reasonable given the scale of the issue. "
Works on boiler were completed before customer returned home. Have checked with Gas supervisor and the LGSR check 12/9/22 would have not caused the leak on 26/9/22 although unfortunate this is through no fault of the enginner who attended on 12/9/22. Explained that there may have been a miscommunication around when the repair to the boiler was going to take place and we would have made sure the works were carried out before her mother returned home.
Works raised to add vent to cupboard which will improve ventilation will also apply bacdet wash to cupbord and bathroom and paint with damp proof paint. Also need to look at extractor fan in wet room.. Have given the customer advice on how they can help prevent damp and mould but the damp issues here are not caused by the customers ctions as the house was well kept and at the time of visit was well ventilated. 
Works required to the property agreed with the customer (and itemised in the response letter). Works required have been - or will be - completed and the property will be fit for the tenant to move back into on 18/10/21. Compensation of £250 offered for the inconvenience/distress plus commitment given to reimburse gas/electricity/council tax costs for the period during which customer could not live in the property (evidence awaited).
works should had been carried out at void stage. appointment booked with Voids suervisor to discuss further 17/2/23 .
"Works that were the cause of the main complaint have now been rectified after a protracted length of time. However there are two follow on jobs required that were caused by th e original leak and these works have been booked back in, I am waiting on confirmation of exactely what these works were and when they were completed or if outstanding when they will be completed. Inaddition Mr Sonoury was seeking permission to install a second washing mashine and wanted to know the location of th estopcock fo rth emains water supply to the property. Once I have recieved the correct information I will update Mr Sonoury directly. "
Works took longer than anticipated due to specialist works that were required and new suppliers being set up.  Potentially some communication advising the customer on timescales may have been effective however he was under the impression it was being done in December however this was not confirmed.
Works were carried out by contractors and poor workmanship was highlighted by ESW team before complaint was received. I (Joe O'Riordan) had already escalated the issue with Urbaser to rectify the poor cut. During next contract meeting with Urbaser (28/7/21) these issues will be discussed and we will  ask for reassurances over performance. An email has also been sent to Urbaser and  Council informing them of the customers wishes. ESW will be reminded at next team meeting (9/7/21) and via email to continue to highight any sub-standard works carried out by our contractors.
Works were completed but complaint not upheld.
"Would like to make a complaint, I have previously contacted and tried to call but heard nothing back, I am extremely upset and annoyed about the lack of communication that has taken place, to find my storage shed downstairs with all my personal possessions in without a door and my items removed from the shed if things are missing I will be taking further action, where was the communication to tell residents that work was taking place in the block, I am a lone parent with a baby, how will you give us our new keys? Not happy, fire safety and personal safety at risk"
Yes - shower to be replaced and (resident to pay for this) GCH to take ownership for any future maintanence.
"YMs Lacey explained it had been 3 week since JP had visited. JP had advised an opinion was needed from a structural engineer, this was undertaken on 19/12. I advised that this was due to the engieers other engagements and his annual leave as we did not have the resourcesd in house to undertake. Advised Ms Lacey this may be an insurance matter and progress may be slow, alos explained we will need to liaise with the tree officer at the city council and they have differing turnaround times than GCH. Apologoised fo delays and committed to improving communication thoughout."
